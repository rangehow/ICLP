It has a big core that's made mainly of iron, so it's quite dense. Because Mercury is so small, the core long ago should've cooled enough to form a solid ball. Yet the planet generates a weak magnetic field, hinting that the core is still at least partially molten.\\nThe solution to this puzzle may involve an iron \\\"snow\\\" deep within the core.\\nThe iron in the core is probably mixed with sulfur, which has a lower melting temperature than iron.

Small bits of solid iron fall toward the center of the planet. This creates convection currents -- like a pot of boiling water. The motion is enough to create a \\\"dynamo\\\" effect.

No one has got anything else that seems to fit all the observations better.\\\"\\nScientists believe the organic material, which is about twice as dark as most of Mercury's surface, was mixed in with comet- or asteroid-delivered ice eons ago.\\nThe ice vaporized, then re-solidified where it was colder, leaving dark deposits on the surface. Radar imagery shows the dark patches subside at the coldest parts of the crater, where ice can exist on the surface.\\nThe areas where the dark patches are seen are not cold enough for surface ice without the overlying layer of what is believed to be organics.\\nSo remote was the idea of organics on Mercury that MESSENGER got a relatively easy pass by NASA's planetary protection protocols that were established to minimize the chance of contaminating any indigenous life-potential material with hitchhiking microbes from Earth.\\nScientists don't believe Mercury is or was suitable for ancient life, but the discovery of organics on an inner planet of the solar system may shed light on how life got started on Earth and how life may evolve on planets beyond the solar system.\\n\\\"Finding a place in the inner solar system where some of these same ingredients that may have led to life on Earth are preserved for us is really exciting,\\\" Paige said.\\nMESSENGER, which stands for Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging, is due to complete its two-year mission at Mercury in March.\\nScientists are seeking NASA funding to continue operations for at least part of a third year. The probe will remain in Mercury's orbit until the planet's gravity eventually causes it to crash onto the surface.\\nWhether the discovery of organics now prompts NASA to select a crash zone rather than leave it up to chance remains to be seen.

Many of us sitting at home, though, have no idea what wind shear is, or if we do, how it affects tornado production.\\nWhat is Wind Shear\\nWind shear, although it might sound complex, is a simple concept. Wind shear is merely the change in wind with height, in terms of wind direction and speed. I think that we all understand that the wind is generally stronger in the atmosphere over our heads than it is here on the ground, and if we think of the atmosphere in terms of the three dimensions that it has, it should not be surprising that the wind above us might also be blowing from a different direction than the wind at the ground. When that happens\u2013the wind speed and direction vary with height\u2013wind shear is occurring.\\nWind Shear and Supercell Thunderstorms\\nThis wind shear is an important part of the process in the development of a supercell thunderstorm, from which the vast majority of strong tornadoes form.\\nAll thunderstorms are produced by a powerful updraft\u2013a surge of air that rises from the ground into the upper levels of the atmosphere, and when this updraft forms in an area where wind shear is present, the updraft is influence by this speed and different direction of the wind above, pushing the column of air in the updraft into a more vertical alignment.\\nRain\u2019s Influence on Tornado Production\\nNeedless to say, thunderstorms typically produce very heavy rain, and rain-cooled air is much heavier than the warm air of the updraft, so the rain-cooled air, produces a compensating downdraft (what comes up, must come down). This downdraft pushes the part of the rotating air that was forced in its direction by the stronger wind aloft downward, and the result is a horizontal column of rotating air.\\nThat\u2019s Not a Tornado!\\nI know what you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019ve seen enough TLC or Discovery Channel shows to know that a horizontal column of air is NOT a tornado; you need a vertical column of air.\\nThis Can Be a Tornado\\nYou\u2019re right, but remember the updraft that is driving the thunderstorm is still working, and it\u2019s able to pull the horizontal, spinning column of air into the thunderstorm, resulting in a vertical column of spinning air.\\n(NOAA image showing vertical column of air in a supercell thunderstorm)\\nThe result is a rotating thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado, and it would not be possible without wind shear.\\n(NOAA image showing tornado formation in supercell thunderstorm)\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:7400301c-e625-46d5-be90-1020cf8d52f8>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://cloudyandcool.com/2009/05/05/wind-shear-and-tornadoes/\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9167638421058655, \"token_count\": 573, \"score\": 4.15625, \"int_score\": 4}\n"

"{\"text\": \"How to get Shading Right\\nRecent improvements to window technology make substantial air conditioning energy savings possible. However, shading remains a time-tested method to accomplish the same end.\\nArchitectural and site shading can have an even greater impact on reducing daily cooling use than upgrading windows. Using both a prototype building and modeling simulations, a study by our team at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) evaluated the relative impacts of different solar load control strategies. The study points the way toward optimizing the interaction of various methods for reducing solar heat gain. This is helpful,as the wide variety of shading options currently available can make choosing an effective solar load control strategy confusing (see Snapshots of Shading Options,HE Sept/Oct '00,p.20).\\nThe prototype house was built in 1998 in Tucson, Arizona, as part of the Department of Energy's Building America program.Its integrated package of energy-saving features includes structural insulated panels (SIPs) for the wall and roof construction, white coating on the roof, spectrally selective windows, architectural shading, an interior location for the air handler and ducts, highefficiency air conditioning equipment, and solar water heating.\\nBuilding America (see Clean Breathing in Tract Homes,p. 29) works with five building industry teams to produce advanced residential buildings on a community scale. Systems incorporated into these houses are evaluated by conducting successive design, test, redesign,and retest iterations until cost and performance trade-offs yield innovations that can be cost effectively implemented in production-scale housing.RGC CourtHomes,Inc., built the prototype, with input from the IBACOS Building America Consortium.\\nBuilding performance was modeled using a detailed hourly energy simulation tool and was measured while the building was unoccupied for a period of 12 days. Model inputs included direct measurements of the net air exchange rate, surface reflectance,and window transmittance. Model results, after calibration,showed good agreement with the direct measurements of cooling loads and air conditioning energy use. Analyzing the interactions between building performance and solar load control strategies in a prototype house can facilitate the optimization of cost and performance trade-offs in large-scale production.\\nTypical new productionscale houses in the Tucson market are framed on a slabon- grade foundation with stucco exterior finish and a sloped concrete tile or flat built-up bituminous roof. These standard-practice houses are built using standard construction materials and techniques, including nominal 2 x 4 wood framing,fiberglass batt insulation,1-inch polystyrene sheathing,and double- pane,clear-glass,aluminum frame windows. The slab foundation has no insulation,and the attic is usually vented. A forcedair distribution system provides space heating and cooling,with the air handler located in the garage and the flex duct in the attic. This system is typically supplied by a 10-SEER air conditioner and an 80% annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) gas furnace.\\nThe prototype house differs from these houses in several respects. It has a well-insulated airtight envelope, with minimized air distribution losses. The house's energy-saving features, plus the large ratio of window to floor area in the design, render window contributions more important than they are in conventional housing, particularly in the Tucson climate.\\nThe prototype incorporates several reengineered features into its structural and mechanical equipment systems (see Table 1). Envelope changes include a sealed, insulated, and conditioned crawlspace foundation (a shallow basement) and SIPs (see SIPs Face the Skeptics,HE,Mar/Apr '98). The foundation stem walls are 6-inchthick reinforced concrete, insulated on the interior with a 2-inch-thick rigid foam board (R-10) that serves as the concrete form. Each wall and roof panel consists of a polyurethane foam core sandwiched between 7/16- inch thick oriented strand board (OSB) sheathing. SIPs 41/2 -inches thick are used for the walls, and SIPs 61/2 -inches thick form the flat lowslope ceiling/roof assembly. The walls are finished with synthetic stucco on the exterior. The roof panels are finished with a white singleply rubberized fabric coating on the exterior (the inside is cathedralized, with no attic space). The windows have vinyl frames with a thermal break,double panes, and spectrally selective coatings on the inside of the outer pane (surface two) of the tinted glazing.\\nMechanical system features include putting the air handler in an interior chase, locating all ductwork within the conditioned space,and installing a 12-SEER (seasonal energy efficiency ratio) air conditioner. A batch-type solar water heater, with an integral collector storage unit,preheats domestic hot water. The gasfired water heater is coupled with an integrated hydronic space-heating coil in the air handler. The house has a controlled-ventilation system consisting of a separate,single-speed and manual-switch fan that supplies fresh air on demand from the outside to the air handler return plenum.\\nThis ranch-style house is located in a high-density, single-family residential development (see cover photo). The architectural plan has approximately 1,170 ft2 of floor area, including two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The house has a relatively large window area with 272 ft2; four sliding glass doors facing a patio make up about 80% of this window area. The sliding glass doors are partially shaded by the patio cover,which is 24 ft long, 6 ft wide, and 10 ft above ground level (see photograph on p. 24). The front entrance is a solid wood door. Another overhang on the front elevation of the house is an open horizontal trellis made of nominal 2 x 6 lumber; vegetation has been planted and is intended to grow over it. Prior to testing, the interior of the house was fully finished and landscaping was complete. No interior window coverings were installed during the test period.\\nBuilding performance measurements included environmental conditions, net air exchange rate,and electric power use during normal operation of the building (see Measuring Thermal Performance). In addition, cooling loads were measured using a co-cooling test protocol in which a six-zone portable air conditioning unit was substituted for the building\u2019s air conditioner. The modeled and measured results were compared; the results showed good agreement for cooling loads and air conditioning energy use. The model was then used to evaluate annual energy use and the impacts of alternative solar load control strategies over a broader range of conditions than could be measured in the field.\\nThe simulation model includes accurate building geometry to account for the effects of shading on windows and walls. The windows are all generally well shaded, either by overhangs or by the adjacent houses. The simulation model was imported into a three-dimensional graphic representation program that has rotational view capabilities to check building geometry.Figure 1 shows the location of exterior walls, windows,doors, and overhangs. Crawlspace walls are evident in this view. Shading from adjacent houses is significant at this site. The geometry of houses and fences to the east and west are modeled as measured at the site; these shading surfaces are also shown in the figure.\\nHow the Shading Options Added Up\\nFor the determination of annual heating and cooling energy,occupied building operation is simulated. The simulation of occupied conditions in this building for a full year predicts that 3,285 kWh of cooling energy and 71 therms of space-heating energy are required per year. Heat gain through the windows is the largest component of envelope load, and it constitutes more than 30% of the total cooling energy load (see Figures 2 and 3).\\nFigure 4 presents the daily load profiles of air conditioning electricity use on a typical cooling day for four combinations of glazing and shading. In this case, the shading includes both the architectural overhangs and the site shading from adjacent buildings. Standard glazing without shading represents the worst case, and spectrally selective glazing with shading (the existing building) represents the best case. The combination of high-performance glazing and shading achieves a 0.4 kW (14%) reduction in afternoon peak electricity demand and a 12.4 kWh (30%) reduction in daily total electricity used for air conditioning. Architectural and site shading reduces daily cooling use more than upgrading the windows does. The shading combination reduces daily cooling energy use by 9.4 kWh (22%), as compared to 4.4 kWh (11%) for just upgrading the windows.\\nArchitectural shading is clearly very important in reducing cooling loads. It reduces the annual cooling requirement by approximately 23%, whether one starts with standard double-pane glazing or with spectrally selective glazing. In both cases, the heating load increases as the solar gain is reduced, but thanks to the combination of the Tucson climate and the wellinsulated tight building shell, this has little impact. Even in the worst\\ncase scenario, less than 80 therms per year of space heating is required.\\nIn this housing development, site shading plays an important role in reducing morning and evening direct solar gain. The test house is shaded to the east and west by adjacent, two-story houses. This site shading not only reduces the solar gain through the windows, but effectively shades much of the exterior wall area, reducing overall conductive gains as well.\\nAnnual Energy Costs\\nThe cooling and heating loads are combined into a single value by converting the energy requirements to costs. The study assumed that electricity costs 10.5\u00a2/kWh, and natural gas costs 79\u00a2/therm for the first 20 therms a month and 75\u00a2/therm above that. Figure 5 shows annual cooling and heating costs as a function of glazing type, two types of shading, and the orientation of the front of the house. Using the data from this figure and referencing a base case building with standard windows with no overhangs but with adjacent building shading, Table 2 presents the reduction in cooling and heating costs for a subset of combinations.\\nThe existing building has a south orientation, and the combined features lead to a 26% reduction in cooling and heating costs. The total cost of cooling and heating is reduced by more than 10% by adding the presence of the adjacent houses. As expected, the maximum effect from architectural shading occurs if the front of the house faces west, which orients most of the window area to the south. The maximum effect of site shading occurs if the front of the house faces north, which orients most of the window area to the west.With the front facing east, the majority of windows are on the north side, and neither architectural nor site shading has much effect on cooling and heating costs.\\n- FIRST PAGE\\n- PREVIOUS PAGE\\nEnter your comments in the box below:\\n(Please note that all comments are subject to review prior to posting.)\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:7fc7b7ef-acfe-4630-b7d8-bbc8efdadf7d>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.homeenergy.org/newsite2011/public/index.php/show/article/nav/buildingamerica/page/4/id/242\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.941486120223999, \"token_count\": 2245, \"score\": 2.921875, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"And as good as today's beginning stages of deflation may feel, especially when filling up at a service station or shopping for a house, economists warn that there is a high price to pay down the road and that current monetary policy is only raising that price.\\nOf course, not all price reductions are created equal. A price drop that stems primarily from an increase in technological efficiency is not deflation; it's progress. Deflation is a fall in prices that stems from a shrinking money supply, just as inflation is a price hike that stems from an increase in the supply of money.\\nDeflation ramps up when people borrow to make a big purchase on the assumption that what they are buying will be worth more later. But if prices fall, the loan will have to be repaid in dollars that are worth more than the dollars they borrowed, making the debt more onerous. As a result, when people expect falling prices, they become less willing to spend, and in particular less willing to borrow. And when that happens, the economy may stay depressed because people expect deflation, and deflation may continue because the economy remains depressed. It's a nasty cycle and it can often be traced back to the central bank's balance sheet expansion.\\nDeflation is the one thing that a leveraged economy can't handle, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. The implication on the whole economy is potentially ruinous. The idea that every time the stock markets have some kind of a hiccup and they [the Fed policymakers] need to rush in with some sort of quantitative ease is a dangerous road for them to go on.\\nDeflation is always a risk if you engage in a policy of inflation, said Albert Lu, managing director and chief portfolio manager of WB Advisors.\\nThe problem with the addiction to money-printing is that it can't stop without dire -- albeit in the long-term healthy -- short-term economic consequences, he said.\\nTo jump-start the economy, the central bank would increase the money supply and bank credit to support certain sectors or projects. That's what the Fed did after the dot-com bubble of 1995-2000 burst. The problem is that once the Fed stops the infusion of additional credit and money, deflation rapidly takes hold. It then takes an ever-increasing amount of new money creation to achieve a temporary suppression of deflation's symptoms.\\nInflation-sustained projects are unsustainable because the expansion rests on government fiat, not economic fundamentals like supply and demand. Take the government's determination to promote home ownership. That public policy was advanced with easy money, especially during Alan Greenspan's leadership of the Fed, compulsory lending to unqualified borrowers and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying tranches of subprime mortgages. Home ownership boomed. And then it collapsed. Home prices still haven't recovered: U.S. home prices fell in March (the latest data available), ending the first quarter at the lowest levels since the housing crisis began in mid-2006, according to Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price indexes. Prices are down roughly 35 percent from their peak in the second quarter of 2006.\\nEssentially, as soon as the government stops the expansion, you are going to hit one of these deflationary corrections with all of the nasty business cycles that accompany it, Lu said.\\nAnd often how the government reacts to that is with additional stimulus. For a third year in a row, the U.S. is seeing an economic slowdown and in response, policymakers could be unveiling policy sequels such as: Fiscal Stimulus 4, Operation Twist 2 or Quantitative Easing 3.\\nThey are basically keeping the thing going by continuously adding money and credit, Lu said. This is just delaying the correction we need.\\nWe've been prolonging the agony, and the final correction will be much worse than it had to be, Lu said.\\nLet Them Fail\\nThe depression of 1920-21 shows why the Fed should sit on its collective hands at their June Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\\nFrom the spring of 1920 to the summer of 1921, nominal gross domestic product fell by 23.9 percent, wholesale prices by 40.8 percent and the consumer price index dropped by 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment topped out at about 14 percent from a pre-bust level of as low as 2 percent.\\nIn response, the administration of Warren G. Harding balanced the budget and the Fed tightened money supply, pushing up short-term rates in mid-depression to as high as 8.13 percent.\\nHarding also decided to let the ailing businesses fail. Then something wonderful happened: The economy purged itself and by 1923, the nation's unemployment rate fell back to 3.2 percent.\\nThere was no government bailout, no rock-bottom interest rates, no QE, no stimulus of any kind. Yet the depression ended.\\nWe actually need a deflation. Believe it or not, it's actually healthy, Lu said. However painful it is, deflation is the natural consequence of prior inflation and is a necessary step in the economic recovery.\\nTrying to avoid it through additional Fed action will prolong the depression, Lu said.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:03b5b79f-c0ee-4372-9eef-383f13bec1be>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.ibtimes.com/us-economists-warn-fed-setting-us-deflation-705540\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9550973176956177, \"token_count\": 1057, \"score\": 2.625, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"When it comes to solar power, the real dilemmas are efficiency and cost. On the one hand, efficiency has steadily improved over the last couple decades to the point where it\u2019s approaching the utility prices of other power generation methods. Exotic technologies promise even greater gains. However, the price of solar-generated power still remains at least five times as expensive as coal-power, the chief source of power in the U.S. (compared to the leading candidate, nuclear, which is approximately 1.5 to 2 times as expensive).\\nWhile solar adoption from a cost standpoint is unattractive, there's much debate over whether commercial adoption is needed to spur further research to propel solar into the realm of cost competitiveness. While many nations like the U.S. and China have modestly taken this position, adopting solar at a moderate rate, one nation has fallen head over heels for solar -- Spain.\\nSpain is allowing solar and wind power plants to charge as much as 10 times the rates of coal power plants, making it possible for solar power installations to earn utilities big money. On average, recent rate increases have raised solar charges to over 7 times the rates of coal or natural gas rates. The costs are added onto consumers' power bills.\\nThe results are mixed; while Spanish power bills are at record highs, the number of deployments is soaring. Spain has 14 GW of solar power, or the equivalent capacity of nine average nuclear reactors, under construction -- the most of any nation. Florida\u2019s FPL Group Inc. and French Electricite de France SA are among the many jumping to build in Spain.\\nGabriel Calzada, an economist and professor at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, states, \\\"Who wouldn\u2019t want to enter a business that\u2019s paid many times more than the market rate, and where the customer is guaranteed for life?\\\"\\nBy 2009, 42 percent of Spaniards energy bills -- approximately 95 euros ($127) on average -- will be provided by alternative energy. Spanish law requires power distributors to buy all clean energy produced in the first 25 years of the plants' lives. The government also recently raised the rate of Spain believes this sacrifice will pay off as fossil fuel resources become depleted and emissions standards tighten.\\nKarsten von Blumenthal, an industrial analyst at Hamburg-based SES Research GmbH states, \\\"The guarantee is more attractive than what other countries offer. Actually the U.S. has better space for solar, in the deserts of California and Nevada.\\\"\\nThe U.S. meanwhile is also advancing thanks in part to President Obama's solar initiatives passed earlier this year as part of the federal stimulus legislation. Over 6 GW of capacity is planned for the U.S.\\nFred Morse, an official at the Washington- based Solar Energy Industries Association trade group and author of the first report to the White House on solar power (1969), says that the U.S. needs to adopt more incentives if it hopes to catch Spain. He states, \\\"The incentives, if implemented promptly and effectively, should greatly facilitate the financing of these plants.\\\"\\nOne promising benefit of the Spanish solar boom is that it is increasing the number of plants utilizing new, potentially more efficient technologies like solar thermal or sterling engines. Spain is limiting the number of photovoltaic plants (solar panel-based designs), but is giving out unlimited licenses for solar thermal and other alternative plants.\\nquote: 1 - Solar Tech is improving very quickly. In another 3~5 years, it SHOULD be just as cheap as coal.\\nquote: 4 - If many people buy their own, it reduces the drain on the electrical system\\nquote: 2 - If its cheap, unlike a power plant (coar / nuke) Anyone can buy it and install it on their roof or their yard.

"{\"text\": \"On February 1st, the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the \u201cConvention\u201d) announced the pledges made by countries under the Copenhagen Accord (the \u201cAccord\u201d). Developed country parties to the Accord pledged greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets to be achieved by 2020. Most notably, developing country parties to the Accord also pledged mitigation actions. By the January 31st deadline, pledges had been provided by countries representing approximately 80% of global GHG emissions.\\npledges made under the Accord\\nAdhering to legislation passed in its House of Representatives, the U.S. pledged a 17% reduction from 2005 levels.1 Canada also pledged a 17% reduction from 2005 levels, \u201cto be aligned with the final economy-wide emissions target of the United States in enacted legislation.\u201d2 Like Canada, many parties made pledges contingent on action by others. The European Union, for example, pledged to reduce its emissions 20% below 1990 levels, or by 30% should other parties make comparable commitments.\\nAs an example of a mitigation action pledge of a developing country, China pledged to lower its carbon intensity (per unit GDP) by 40-45% by 2020, to increase to 15% the share of non-fossil fuels used in primary energy consumption, and to increase its forest coverage and forest stock volume.3 In comments following the announcement of the pledges, U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd Stern has made it clear that the U.S. expects of developing countries, stronger mitigation actions than those contained in the Accord.4\\nthe 2009 UN climate change conference\\nThe Accord was the outcome of the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (the \u201cConference\u201d) to the Convention,5 attended by yours truly. In an unprecedented display of the prominence that climate change is gaining on the world stage, the Conference was attended by 115 heads of state and over 40,000 delegates.\\nThe stage that was the Conference was not without its share of theatrics. When the leaders arrived in the final days to find that little progress had been made, the drama moved behind the scenes. In a telling moment, frustrated by negotiating only with Chinese Premier Wen\u2019s aides, U.S. President Obama walked in on a private meeting between Wen and the leaders of Brazil, India, and South Africa.6 It was largely these five major economies that would go on to produce the Accord, which calls for any global temperature increase to be limited to two degrees Celsius.7\\nHowever the parties to the Convention\u2019s Kyoto Protocol (the \u201cProtocol\u201d), the first commitment period of which ends in 2012, were unable to agree to its extension. The lack of consensus leaves in suspension the status of the Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the value of the Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) generated by thousands of projects thereunder. The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), which held a parallel conference, nevertheless remains optimistic: \u201can international injection of increased demand remains a strong possibility over investment timescales but still has to be treated as an upside rather than a given.\u201d8\\nback on the home front\\nAs mentioned above, Canada\u2019s climate change policy is explicitly tied to that of the United States. 2009 saw in the U.S. the passage in the House of Representatives of the American Clean Energy and Security Act (\u201cWaxman-Markey\u201d). Waxman-Markey calls for a 17% reduction of emissions below 2005 levels by 2020 and provides for the trading of allowances.9 Debate in the U.S. Senate of the similar Kerry-Boxer bill is nominally scheduled for debate this spring, though it may be 2011 before it comes to a floor vote. Tri-partisan senators John Kerry (D), Lindsey Graham (R) and Joe Lieberman (I) have taken it upon themselves to ensure passage of a climate (or \u201cenergy independence\u201d) bill.\\nFor many U.S. senators, any climate legislation must be accompanied by developing country emissions reductions and the international verification thereof. As China and others are less keen on international monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), the Accord features compromise language. Countries will communicate their actions \u201cwith provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure national sovereignty is respected.\u201d10 In any case, with more than two thirds of Americans supporting the regulation of GHG emissions,11 the passage of legislation through Congress and, consequently, Canadian federal regulation, may be on the horizon.\\nInternational climate change negotiations will occur in a number of fora this year. While the sixteenth Conference of the Parties will occur in December in Cancun, one might now wonder how much can be expected of 192-party negotiations. In June, Canada will host the G8 and G20 summits, and it is rumoured that climate change policy may be included on the agenda.12 Finally, it is likely that a second meeting of the Major Economies Forum will occur later this year to discuss climate policy.13\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:7a4001a3-a36b-492a-9b85-d3408119e643>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7a718b20-b3df-42cc-a2bf-e2dc617af9ef\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9496594667434692, \"token_count\": 1055, \"score\": 3.109375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

The effect of more frequent hurricanes, floods and droughts on developing countries is devastating, as this year\u2019s cyclone Nagris proved again in southern Myanmar, leaving over 130,000 people dead or missing.\\nTo protect the world\u2019s poor against today\u2019s more frequent extreme weather events, some US$ 2 billion is required according to the Internacional relief agency Oxfam. However, commitments so far only total US$173.\\nThe need for innovative means to mitigate climate change impacts and help poor countries adapt is high on the agenda of the World Conservation Congress, held by IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature from 5-14 October in Barcelona.\\n- In 2007, there were 950 natural catastrophes in 2007 compared with 850 in 2006, according to Munich Re, one of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies. This is the highest number recorded since the company started compiling annual disaster reports in 1974.\\n- The burden of the disasters fall on the poor who are least to blame for climate change. Benin, and Bangladesh, for example, are at particularly high risk from rising sea-levels and storm surges, yet their per capita contribution to greenhouse gas output is one eightieth that of the United States, according to the British Institute of Development Studies.\\n- \u201cWhat worries us the most is the impact on the poorest countries which have the least capacity to respond to the challenge,\u201d said Yvo de Boer, secretary of the Convention on Climate Change.\\n- A healthy environment can help people survive. Healthy mangrove forests and coral reefs, for example, can serve as barriers and prevent coastal erosion; a solid forest cover prevents flooding in times of heavy rainfall.\\n- \u201cThere are positive examples of local level adaptation to the impacts of climate change, such as replanting mangrove forests that can serve as buffers against more frequent storms.

"{\"text\": \"Born in 1940, Wangari Maathai is a Kenyan ecologist and environmental activist who founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977, causing the media to depict her as a latter-day Johnny Appleseed who has planted millions of trees in Africa. (The Green Belt Movement has been responsible for the planting of more than 10 million trees to prevent soil erosion and provide a source of firewood.)\\nAs a member of the Green Belt Movement, Maathai has led sub-Saharan African women in provoking sometimes-violent clashes with police. Though casting herself as a hero of the downtrodden, she has demonstrated against peasants\u2019 economic interests. When Kenyan autocratic leader Daniel arap Moi wanted to revive the nation\u2019s dead economy by building the world\u2019s largest skyscraper in the capital, her riotous actions dried up investment. Later, she led a protest to prevent \u201csmall-scale farming\u201d on African forestland and called farmers \u201cinvaders\u201d who were guilty of \u201crape.\u201d In 1992, she and the women in her Green Belt Movement foreshadowed contemporary Western antiwar demonstrators by staging a public strip-in.\\nIn 2004 she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201creversing deforestation across Africa.\u201d\\nWhen Maathai was awarded her Nobel Prize, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan paid her a glowing tribute:\\nMaathai is also an anti-white, anti-Western crusader for international socialism. She charges that \u201csome sadistic [white] scientists\u201d created the AIDS virus \u201cto punish blacks\u201d and, ultimately, \u201cto wipe out the black race.\u201d Maathai continues:\\n\u201cRenowned and admired throughout her native Kenya and across Africa for her pioneering struggle against deforestation and for women\u2019s rights and democracy, Ms. Maathai has also played an important role at UN conferences such as the Earth Summit, making an imprint on the global quest for sustainable development.... Selfless and steadfast, Ms. Maathai has been a champion of the environment, of women, of Africa, and of anyone concerned about our future security.\u201d\\n\u201cSome say that AIDS came from the monkeys, and I doubt that, because we have been living with monkeys [since] time immemorial; others say it was a curse from God, but I say it cannot be that.... Us black people are dying more than any other people in this planet. It\u2019s true that there are some people who create agents to wipe out other people.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy is the rest of the world just watching,\u201d Maathai asks, \u201cdoing nothing while Africans are being wiped out? The rest of the world has abandoned us.\u201d\\nThere is, of course, a very real genocide throughout sub-Saharan Africa, as Muslim Arabs murder indigenous black Christians and animists, 100,000 in Darfur alone. The repeated rape of young black boys by Arabs is now commonplace. These scenes first played out during the genocide in Rwanda, which began early in the Clinton administration, and have been seen all over the sub-continent for a decade. Maathai addressed this brutality at the World Women\u2019s Conference in Beijing in 1995, where she blamed it on Western capitalists. She claims that Western governments laid the groundwork for present slaughter during the Cold War. \u201cThe carnage goes on in Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia and in the streets of many cities,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople of Africa continue to be sacrificed so that some factories may stay open, earn capital and save jobs.\u201d\\nThus in Maathai\u2019s view, Arab genocide is the fault of wealthy whites.\\nMaathai has courted global socialism through her long association with the United Nations\u2019 environmentalist agenda. She was a member of the Commission on Global Governance (CGG), founded in 1992 at the suggestion of former West German Chancellor and socialist Willy Brandt. Maathai worked on the CGG alongside Maurice Strong, Jimmy Carter, and Robert McNamara. The group\u2019s manifesto, \u201cOur Global Neighborhood,\u201d calls for a dramatic reordering of the world\u2019s political power \u2013 and redistribution of the world\u2019s wealth.\\nMost importantly, the CGG\u2019s proposals would phase out America\u2019s veto in the Security Council. At the same time, the CGG would increase UN authority over member nations, declaring, \u201cAll member-states of the UN that have not already done so should accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court.\u201d It asks the UN to prevail upon member governments to enact proposals made by wide NGOs \u2013 such as the Green Belt Movement. \u201cOur Global Neighborhood\u201d also suggested creating a 10,000-man \u201cUN Volunteer Force\u201d to be deployed at the UN\u2019s approval on infinite peacekeeping missions everywhere (except Iraq).\\nMaathai currently acts as a commissioner for the Earth Charter, along with the aforementioned Maurice Strong, Mikhail Gorbachev and Steven Rockefeller. She is also on the Earth Charter\u2019s Steering Committee. In addition to calling for sharing the \u201cbenefits of development . . . equitably,\u201d the Earth Charter calls on international bodies to \u201cPromote the equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations.\u201d Another Charter provision would disarm the entire world and use the money previously allocated for national defense to restore the environment. Additionally, the Earth Charter worries about the \u201cunprecedented rise in human population,\u201d and demands \u201cuniversal access to health care.\u201d\\nMaathai earned her biology degree from Mount St. Scholastica College in Kansas and a Master\u2019s degree at the University of Pittsburgh. She later returned to Kenya and worked in veterinary medical research at the University of Nairobi, eventually earning a Ph.D. there and becoming head of the veterinary medicine faculty.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:fae983e5-45da-44d4-86c0-5ccc7cb210d8>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://discoverthenetworks.com/printindividualProfile.asp?indid=2007\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9558945298194885, \"token_count\": 1242, \"score\": 2.84375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"Reversal of fortune\\nTo unlock the vast, untapped potential of the world\u2019s drylands, we must learn from the people who live in them, says Dr Jonathan Davies.\\nDrylands are a major global biome, home to a great diversity of species and some of our most treasured natural heritage. They are also home to over 2 billion people and in the developing world in particular they are associated with poverty and social inequity. Global development and environment goals are not being met in the drylands: by 2015 many dryland regions are set to fail to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, whilst progress towards the goals and objectives of the UN environmental conventions (the Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biological Diversity in particular) is generally poor.\\nRecent experiences in the drylands of emerging countries, such as China and India, illustrate that economic development in drylands can outpace that in areas that are usually considered \u201chigh potential\u201d. Although development is often associated with degradation, experiences in Sub Saharan Africa illustrate that economic development can be greatly enhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. By taking an even broader, global view of drylands and examining industrialised dryland countries, it becomes clear that for every seemingly-insurmountable challenge we are able to find evidence of a viable solution somewhere in the world.\\nTo address the challenges of the drylands, we need to understand their unique features and how these have to be managed. Perhaps the most important of these is climate unpredictability: the amount of precipitation varies enormously between areas, between seasons and between years. The sheer magnitude of this uncertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought-years aside, can be plus or minus 50% of the average. Yet development in many water-deficit areas continues to favour agricultural practices that expose farmers to huge risks whilst simultaneously degrading the natural resource base on which they depend.\\nClimate change is a cause for concern in dryland areas, but also an opportunity for new approaches and new learning that illustrate the value of dryland areas. Dryland ecosystems and people are highly adaptable and can survive in their uncertain climate.. Whether drylands become wetter or drier as a result of climate change, they will almost invariably become more unpredictable and their adaptive capacity will be vital to their future. Drylands more than any other ecosystem have the capacity to deal with that unpredictability and we have a great deal to learn from them.\\nContrary to popular perception, drylands are not necessarily poverty traps. Dryland ecosystems and their goods and services already contribute significantly to national and international economies. The vibrant tourism sector in Eastern and Southern Africa relies heavily on the biodiversity of drylands. Globally-important dryland commodities include grain, meat and milk and dryland goods like Gum Arabic, Henna, Aloe, and Frankincense. Recent years have seen the commercial development of natural medicines from drylands, and untold numbers of medicinal plants remain un-researched, known only to the dryland inhabitants who have used and conserved them for centuries.\\nLocal knowledge of the drylands is rich and is a powerful resource to be harnessed. There has been a tendency to dismiss this knowledge, because local dryland practices have been portrayed as backward or inappropriate and in need of replacing. The current emergency in the Horn of Africa graphically illustrates the outcome of this attitude: populations are exposed to insupportable risk as a result of losing their traditional strategies and being pushed into new ways of life that simply don\u2019t work. Where people are driven towards catastrophe it is almost guaranteed that the environment will face similar consequences. Customs and cultures that are intimately connected to biodiversity become contorted into a system of pure survival where respect for the environment becomes an unaffordable luxury.\\nThe scientific explanation of the rationale behind traditional strategies has been known for long enough to develop innovative new approaches to sustainable drylands management. Development support has to enable management of the extreme climatic uncertainty of drylands and needs to be built on understanding of the drivers of continuous change in dryland ecosystems. These are dynamic ecosystems in which adaptation and flexibility are pre-requisites for survival. We need to learn from past failures and successes and ensure that development and humanitarian interventions recognize dryland characteristics and build on local knowledge and capacity to turn the existing opportunities into equitable and sustainable wealth creation. In particular we need to generate greater awareness of the tremendous opportunities for strengthening biodiversity-based livelihoods to diversify dryland economies and strengthen resilience.\\nIUCN\u2019s vision 2020 emphasizes the need to strengthen the Union\u2019s work on conserving the diversity of life while also connecting nature conservation to wider societal objectives such as security and poverty reduction. This vision cannot be reached if we fail to understand and address the unique challenges of the drylands. IUCN, with its great diversity of members and commission members, has a vital role to play in securing effective global action to address dryland issues and in enabling dryland communities to develop their nature-based solutions to risk management and sustainable development.\\nDr Jonathan Davies is Coordinator of IUCN\u2019s Global Drylands Initiative.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:f420729b-433d-4fa6-8cfe-c81ae093a2da>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://cms.iucn.org/knowledge/focus/previous_focus_topics/saving_our_drylands/opinion/?8350/Reversal-of-fortune&add_comment\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9456223845481873, \"token_count\": 1052, \"score\": 3.265625, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

This surpasses the 10% target proposed a decade earlier, at the Caracas Congress, for 9 out of 14 major terrestrial biomes. Such uniform targets based on percentage of area have become deeply embedded into national and international conservation planning. Although politically expedient, the scientific basis and conservation value of these targets have been questioned. In practice, however, little is known of how to set appropriate targets, or of the extent to which the current global protected area network fulfils its goal of protecting biodiversity. Here, we combine five global data sets on the distribution of species and protected areas to provide the first global gap analysis assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in representing species diversity.

"{\"text\": \"Now he\u2019s alerted me to a new study and related lecture on what he and his co-authors are calling \u201cpeak farmland\u201d \u2014 an impending stabilization of the amount of land required for food as humanity\u2019s growth spurt plays out. While laying out several important wild cards (expanded farming of biofuels among them), Ausubel and his co-authors see a reasonable prospect for conserving, and restoring, forests and other stressed terrestrial ecosystems even as humanity exerts an ever greater influence on the planet.\\nThe study, \u201cPeak Farmland and the Prospects for Sparing Nature,\u201d is by Ausubel, Iddo K. Wernick and Paul E. Waggoner and will be published next year as part of a special supplement to the journal Population and Development Review, published by the Population Council.\\nDrawing on a host of data sets, the authors conclude that a combination of slowing population growth, moderated demand for land-intensive food (meat, for instance) and more efficient farming methods have resulted in a substantial \u201cdecoupling\u201d of acreage and human appetites.\\nHere\u2019s the optimistic opener:\\nExpecting that more and richer people will demand more from the land, cultivating wider fields, logging more forests, and pressing nature, comes naturally. The past half-century of disciplined and dematerializing demand and more intense and efficient land use encourage a rational hope that humanity\u2019s pressure will not overwhelm nature.\\nAusubel will describe the findings in a talk during a daylong symposium at his university on Tuesday honoring Paul Demeny, who at age 80 is stepping down as editor of the journal.\\nAusubel\u2019s prepared remarks are online. In his talk, he explains that while the common perception is that meeting humanity\u2019s food needs is the task of farmers, there are many other players, including those of us who can choose what to eat and how many children to have:\\n[T]he main actors are parents changing population, workers changing affluence, consumers changing the diet (more or less calories, more or less meat) and also the portion of crops entering the food supply (corn can fuel people or cars), and farmers changing the crop production per hectare of cropland (yield).\\nThe new paper builds on a long string of studies by Ausubel and the others, including the 2001 paper \u201cHow Much Will Feeding More and Wealthier People Encroach on Forests?.\u201d Also relevant is \u201cRestoring the Forests,\u201d a 2000 article in Foreign Affairs co-written by Ausubel and David G. Victor (now at the University of California, San Diego)\\nThis body of analysis is closely related to the core focus of this blog: finding ways to fit infinite human aspirations (and appetites) on a finite planet. The work presents a compelling case for concentrating agriculture through whatever hybrid mix of means \u2014 technological or traditional \u2014 that best fits particular situations, but also fostering moderation in consumption.\\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from the paper\u2019s conclusion, which notes the many wild cards that make the peak farmland scenario still only a plausible, and hardly inevitable, future:\\n[W]ild cards remain part of the game, both for and against land sparing. As discussed, the wild card of biofuels confounded expectations for the past 15 years. Most wild cards probably will continue to come from consumers. Will people choose to eat much more meat? If so, will it be beef, which requires more land than poultry and fish, which require less? Will people become vegetarian or even vegan? But if they become vegan, will they also choose clothing made from linen, hemp, and cotton, which require hectares? Will the average human continue to grow taller and thus require more calories? Will norms of beauty accept obesity and thus high average calories per capita? Will a global population with a median age of 40 eat less than one with a median age of 28? Will radical innovations in food production move humanity closer to landless agriculture (Ausubel 2010)? Will hunger or international investment encourage cropland expansion in Africa and South America? (Cropland may, of course, shrink in some countries while expanding in others as the global sum declines.) And will time moderate the disparities cloaked within global averages, in particular disparities of hunger and excess among regions and individuals?\\nAllowing for wild cards, we believe that projecting conservative values for population, affluence, consumers, and technology shows humanity peaking in the use of farmland. Over the next 50 years, the prospect is that humanity is likely to release at least 146 mHa [146 million hectares, or 563,710 square miles], one and a half times the size of Egypt, two and a half times that of France, or ten Iowas, and possibly multiples of this amount.\\nNotwithstanding the biofuels case, the trends of the past 15 years largely resemble those for the past 50 and 150. We see no evidence of exhaustion of the factors that allow the peaking of cropland and the subsequent restoration of nature.\\nIn an e-mail exchange today, I asked Ausubel about another issue touched on in the paper:\\nLooking around the planet, it\u2019s clear from a biodiversity standpoint that all forests \u2014 or farming pressures \u2014 are not equal. For instance, in Southeast Asia, palm oil and orangutans are having a particularly hard time co-existing. So while the overall trend is great, do you see the need for maintaining a focus on particular \u201chot spots,\u201d to use a term familiar in environmental circles?\\nSo far, I don\u2019t see lots of evidence that conservation campaigners (you are one on ocean resources) have found a way to accept this kind of good news and/or incorporate it in their prescriptions for sustaining a rich and variegated biological sheath on Earth. If you agree, any idea why?\\nIndonesia is the number one place where letting the underlying trend work will not work fast enough. The list of threatened regions is quite well identified: parts of the central African forest, parts of the Amazon.\\nSome conservation groups have realized that the slow growth in demand for calories as well as pulp and paper are creating big chances to reserve or protect more land. In the right places, where crops are no longer profitable, some amounts of money can acquire large amounts of land for nature.\\nConservation groups also ought to attend more to the ecological disaster called biofuels.\\nI encourage you to dig in on this paper and related work, which provides a useful guide for softening the human impact on a crowding planet. There\u2019ll be plenty of losses, and surprises, but there are real prospects for sustaining a thriving, and peopled, orb.\\n6:57 p.m. | Addendum | For relevant work with somewhat different conclusions review the presentations from \u201cIntensifying agriculture within planetary boundaries,\u201d a session at the Planet Under Pressure conference in London last March.

The Ardennes Offensive was Hitler's bold attempt to capture and hold the Allied army's massive supply of Brussels sprouts, vital - of course - for the full functioning of any army.\\nGerman intelligence were aware that the American army was - in particular - massing huge quantities of the vital Brussels sprouts just behind their frontlines in preparedness for their own massive push - and - of course - in time for Christmas.\\nThe German's audacious plan would have succeeded if the Allies had not quickly worked out that it was their stockpiles of Brussels sprouts that were under immediate threat. The bold plan put forward by the Allied Generals was a heavy gamble, but it paid off. They ordered their front-line chefs to begin boiling their entire stocks of Brussels sprouts, and - most importantly - to keep them boiling well past a state of fully preparedness.\\nSo, when the weather altered and the wind direction changed, it blew the smell of over-cooked Brussels sprouts straight into the faces of the advancing Germans. Then the Reich troops knew that they would not be able to replenish their stocks of Brussels sprouts and any sprouts that they did capture from the Allied frontline kitchens would be overcooked to the point of inedibility.\\nLater in this series, we will discuss the major strategic role that Brussels sprouts have played in world history, such as Hadrian building a wall to protect the Roman Empire's most northern supplies of Brussels sprouts from the northern barbarians, thus thwarting the barbarian's fiendish plan to deep-fry the Roman's entire stockpiles of sprouts.\\nThen there was, also, Napoleon's retreat from Moscow when his over-long supply line of Brussels sprouts direct from France broke down. Even when his troops could get sprouts, they were of poor quality - dry, wizened and frozen solid. Of course, this led to a massive collapse of morale. Eventually, the lack of good quality sprouts forced a massive retreat where thousands of French troops died from a pitiful lack of sprouts.\\nAnd, of course, not forgetting - of course - how the Spanish conquest of the Americas was a result of the Spaniards overwhelming sprout superiority.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:1e42f564-b487-459a-9400-a0404ff31bff>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.abctales.com/story/hadley/brussels-sprouts-and-their-role-history\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9742326736450195, \"token_count\": 518, \"score\": 2.859375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"[Note: in Japan, it is customary to refer to a person with their last name first. We have retained this practice in the below excerpt from Kurosawa\u2019s text.]\\nThe gate was growing larger and larger in my mind\u2019s eye. I was location-scouting in the ancient capital of Kyoto for Rashomon, my eleventh-century period film. The Daiei management was not very happy with the project. They said the content was difficult and the title had no appeal. They were reluctant to let the shooting begin. Day by day, as I waited, I walked around Kyoto and the still-more-ancient capital of Nara a few miles away, studying the classical architecture. The more I saw, the larger the image of the Rashomon gate became in my mind.\\nAt first I thought my gate should be about the size of the entrance gate to Toji Temple in Kyoto. Then it became as large as the Tengaimon gate in Nara, and finally as big as the main two-story gates of the Ninnaji and Todaiji temples in Nara. This image enlargement occurred not just because I had the opportunity to see real gates dating from that period, but because of what I was learning, from documents and relics, about the long-since-destroyed Rashomon gate itself.\\n\u201cRashomon\u201d actually refers to the Rajomon gate; the name was changed in a Noh play written by Kanze Nobumitsu. \u201cRajo\u201d indicates the outer precincts of the castle, so \u201cRajomon\u201d means the main gate to the castle\u2019s outer grounds. The gate for my film Rashomon was the main gate to the outer precincts of the ancient capital--\u2013--\u2013Kyoto was at that time called \u201cHeian-Kyo.\u201d If one entered the capital through the Rajomon gate and continued due north along the main thoroughfare of the metropolis, one came to the Shujakumon gate at the end of it, and the Toji and Saiji temples to the east and west, respectively. Considering this city plan, it would have been strange had the outer main gate not been the biggest gate of all. There is tangible evidence that it in fact was: The blue roof tiles that survive from the original Rajomon gate show that it was large. But, no matter how much research we did, we couldn\u2019t discover the actual dimensions of the vanished structure.\\nAs a result, we had to construct the Rashomon gate to the city based on what we could learn from looking at extant temple gates, knowing that the original was probably different. What we built as a set was gigantic. It was so immense that a complete roof would have buckled the support pillars. Using the artistic device of dilapidation as an excuse, we constructed only half a roof and were able to get away with our measurements. To be historically accurate, the imperial palace and the Shujakumon gate should have been visible looking north through our gate. But on the Daiei back lot such distances were out of the question, and even if we had been able to find the space, the budget would have made it impossible. We made do with a cut-out mountain to be seen through the gate. Even so, what we built was extraordinarily large for an open set.\\nWhen I took this project to Daiei, I told them the only sets I would need were the gate and the tribunal courtyard wall where all the survivors, participants and witnesses of the rape and murder that form the story of the film are questioned. Everything else, I promised them, would be shot on location. Based on this low-budget set estimate, Daiei happily took on the project.\\nLater, Kawaguchi Matsutaro, at that time a Daiei executive, complained that they had really been fed a line. To be sure, only the gate set had to be built, but for the price of that one mammoth set they could have had over a hundred ordinary sets. But, to tell the truth, I hadn\u2019t intended so big a set to begin with. It was while I was kept waiting all that time that my research deepened and my image of the gate swelled to its startling proportions.\\nWhen I had finished Scandal for the Shochiku studios, Daiei asked if I wouldn\u2019t direct one more film for them. As I cast about for what to film, I suddenly remembered a script based on the short story \u201cYabu no naka\u201d (\u201cIn a Grove\u201d) by Akutagawa Ryunosuke. It had been written by Hashimoto Shinobu, who had been studying under director Itami Mansaku. It was a very well-written piece, but not long enough to make into a feature film. This Hashimoto had visited my home, and I talked with him for hours. He seemed to have substance, and I took a liking to him. He later wrote the screenplays for Ikiru (1952) and Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai, 1954) with me. The script I remembered was his Akutagawa adaptation called \u201cMale-Female.\u201d\\nProbably my subconscious told me it was not right to have put that script aside; probably I was\u2014without being aware of it\u2013wondering all the while if I couldn\u2019t do something with it. At that moment the memory of it jumped out of one of those creases in my brain and told me to give it a chance. At the same time I recalled that \u201cIn a Grove\u201d is made up of three stories, and realized that if I added one more, the whole would be just the right length for a feature film. Then I remembered the Akutagawa story \u201cRashomon.\u201d Like \u201cIn a Grove,\u201d it was set in the Heian period (794-1184). The film Rashomon took shape in my mind.\\nSince the advent of the talkies in the 1930s, I felt, we had misplaced and forgotten what was so wonderful about the old silent movies. I was aware of the aesthetic loss as a constant irritation. I sensed a need to go back to the origins of the motion picture to find this peculiar beauty again; I had to go back into the past.\\nIn particular, I believed that there was something to be learned from the spirit of the French avant-garde films of the 1920s. Yet in Japan at this time we had no film library. I had to forage for old films, and try to remember the structure of those I had seen as a boy, ruminating over the aesthetics that had made them special.\\nRashomon would be my testing ground, the place where I could apply the ideas and wishes growing out of my silent-film research. To provide the symbolic background atmosphere, I decided to use the Akutagawa \u201cIn a Grove\u201d story, which goes into the depths of the human heart as if with a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, laying bare its dark complexities and bizarre twists. These strange impulses of the human heart would be expressed through the use of an elaborately fashioned play of light and shadow. In the film, people going astray in the thicket of their hearts would wander into a wider wilderness, so I moved the setting to a large forest. I selected the virgin forest of the mountains surrounding Nara, and the forest belonging to the Komyoji temple outside Kyoto.\\nThere were only eight characters, but the story was both complex and deep. The script was done as straightforwardly and briefly as possible, so I felt I should be able to create a rich and expansive visual image in turning it into a film. Fortunately, I had as cinematographer a man I had long wanted to work with, Miyagawa Kazuo; I had Hayasaka to compose the music and Matsuyama as art director. The cast was Mifune Toshiro, Mori Masayuki, Kyo Machiko, Shimura Takashi, Chiaki Minoru, Ueda Kichijiro, Kato Daisuke and Honma Fumiko; all were actors whose temperaments I knew, and I could not have wished for a better line-up. Moreover, the story was supposed to take place in summer, and we had, ready to hand, the scintillating midsummer heat of Kyoto and Nara. With all these conditions so neatly met, I could ask nothing more. All that was left was to begin the film.\\nHowever, one day just before the shooting was to start, the three assistant directors Daiei had assigned me came to see me at the inn where I was staying. I wondered what the problem could be. It turned out that they found the script baffling and wanted me to explain it to them. \u201cPlease read it again more carefully,\u201d I told them. \u201cIf you read it diligently, you should be able to understand it because it was written with the intention of being comprehensible.\u201d But they wouldn\u2019t leave. \u201cWe believe we have read it carefully, and we still don\u2019t understand it at all; that\u2019s why we want you to explain it to us.\u201d For their persistence I gave them this simple explanation:\\nHuman beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing. This script portrays such human beings\u2013the kind who cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better people than they really are. It even shows this sinful need for flattering falsehood going beyond the grave\u2014even the character who dies cannot give up his lies when he speaks to the living through a medium. Egoism is a sin the human being carries with him from birth; it is the most difficult to redeem. This film is like a strange picture scroll that is unrolled and displayed by the ego. You say that you can\u2019t understand this script at all, but that is because the human heart itself is impossible to understand. If you focus on the impossibility of truly understanding human psychology and read the script one more time, I think you will grasp the point of it.\\nAfter I finished, two of the three assistant directors nodded and said they would try reading the script again. They got up to leave, but the third, who was the chief, remained unconvinced. He left with an angry look on his face. (As it turned out, this chief assistant director and I never did get along. I still regret that in the end I had to ask for his resignation. But, aside from this, the work went well.)\\nDuring the rehearsals before the shooting I was left virtually speechless by Kyo Machiko\u2019s dedication. She came in to where I was still sleeping in the morning and sat down with the script in her hand. \u201cPlease teach me what to do,\u201d she requested, and I lay there amazed. The other actors, too, were all in their prime. Their spirit and enthusiasm was obvious in their work, and equally manifest in their eating and drinking habits.\\nThey invented a dish called Sanzoku-yaki, or \u201cMountain Bandit Broil,\u201d and ate it frequently. It consisted of beef strips saut\u00e9ed in oil and then dipped in a sauce made of curry powder in melted butter. But while they held their chopsticks in one hand, in the other they\u2019d hold a raw onion. From time to time they\u2019d put a strip of meat on the onion and take a bite out of it. Thoroughly barbaric.\\nThe shooting began at the Nara virgin forest. This forest was infested with mountain leeches. They dropped out of the trees onto us, they crawled up our legs from the ground to suck our blood. Even when they had had their fill, it was no easy task to pull them off, and once you managed to rip a glutted leech out of your flesh, the open sore seemed never to stop bleeding. Our solution was to put a tub of salt in the entry of the inn. Before we left for the location in the morning we would cover our necks, arms and socks with salt. Leeches are like slugs\u2014they avoid salt.\\nIn those days the virgin forest around Nara harbored great numbers of massive cryptomerias and Japanese cypresses, and vines of lush ivy twined from tree to tree like pythons. It had the air of the deepest mountains and hidden glens. Every day I walked in this forest, partly to scout for shooting locations and partly for pleasure. Once a black shadow suddenly darted in front of me: a deer from the Nara park that had returned to the wild. Looking up, I saw a pack of monkeys in the big trees about my head.\\nThe inn we were housed in lay at the foot of Mount Wakakusa. Once a big monkey who seemed to be the leader of the pack came and sat on the roof of the inn to stare at us studiously throughout our boisterous evening meal. Another time the moon rose from behind Mount Wakakusa, and for an instant we saw the silhouette of a deer framed distinctly against its full brightness. Often after supper we climbed up Mount Wakakusa and formed a circle to dance in the moonlight. I was still young and the cast members were even younger and bursting with energy. We carried out our work with enthusiasm.\\nWhen the location moved from the Nara Mountains to the Komyoji temple forest in Kyoto, it was Gion Festival time. The sultry summer sun hit with full force, but even though some members of my crew succumbed to heat stroke, our work pace never flagged. Every afternoon we pushed through without even stopping for a single swallow of water. When work was over, on the way back to the inn we stopped at a beer hall in Kyoto\u2019s downtown Shijo-Kawaramachi district. There each of us downed about four of the biggest mugs of draft beer they had. But we ate dinner without any alcohol and, upon finishing, split up to go about our private affairs. Then at ten o\u2019clock we\u2019d gather again and pour whiskey down our throats with a vengeance. Every morning we were up bright and clear-headed to do our sweat-drenched work.\\nWhere the Komyoji temple forest was too thick to give us the light we needed for shooting, we cut down trees without a moment\u2019s hesitation or explanation. The abbot of Komyoji glared fearfully as he watched us. But as the days went on, he began to take the initiative, showing us where he thought trees should be felled.\\nWhen our shoot was finished at the Komyoji location, I went to pay my respects to the abbot. He looked at me with grave seriousness and spoke with deep feeling. \u201cTo be honest with you, at the outset we were very disturbed when you went about cutting down the temple trees as if they belonged to you. But in the end we were won over by your wholehearted enthusiasm. \u2018Show the audience something good.\u2019 This was the focus of all your energies, and you forgot yourselves. Until I had the chance to watch you, I had no idea that the making of a movie was a crystallization of such effort. I was very deeply impressed.\u201d\\nThe abbot finished and set a folding fan before me. In commemoration of our filming, he had written on the fan three characters forming a Chinese poem: \u201cBenefit All Mankind.\u201d I was left speechless.\\nWe set up a parallel schedule for the use of the Komyoji location and open set of the Rashomon gate. On sunny days we filmed at Komyoji; on cloudy days we filmed the rain scenes at the gate set. Because the gate set was so huge, the job of creating rainfall on it was a major operation. We borrowed fire engines and turned on the studio\u2019s fire hoses to full capacity. But when the camera was aimed upward at the cloudy sky over the gate, the sprinkle of the rain couldn\u2019t be seen against it, so we made rainfall with black ink in it. Every day we worked in temperatures of more than 85\u00ba Fahrenheit, but when the wind blew through the wide-open gate with the terrific rainfall pouring down over it, it was enough to chill the skin.\\nI had to be sure that this huge gate looked huge to the camera. And I had to figure out how to use the sun itself. This was a major concern because of the decision to use the light and shadows of the forest as the keynote of the whole film. I determined to solve the problem by actually filming the sun. These days it is not uncommon to point the camera directly at the sun, but at the time Rashomon was being made it was still one of the taboos of cinematography. It was even thought that the sun\u2019s rays shining directly into your lens would burn the film in your camera. But my cameraman, Miyagawa Kazuo, boldly defied this convention and created superb images. The introductory section in particular, which leads the viewer through the light and shadow of the forest into a world where the human heart loses its way, was truly magnificent camera work. I feel that this scene, later praised at the Venice International Film Festival as the first instance of a camera entering the heart of a forest, was not only one of Miyagawa\u2019s masterpieces but a world-class masterpiece of black-and-white cinematography.\\nAnd yet, I don\u2019t know what happened to me. Delighted as I was with Miyagawa\u2019s work, it seems I forgot to tell him. When I said to myself, \u201cWonderful,\u201d I guess I thought I had said \u201cWonderful\u201d to him at the same time. I didn\u2019t realize I hadn\u2019t until one day Miyagawa\u2019s old friend Shimura Takashi (who was playing the woodcutter in Rashomon) came to me and said, \u201cMiyagawa\u2019s very concerned about whether his camera work is satisfactory to you.\u201d Recognizing my oversight for the first time, I hurriedly shouted \u201cOne hundred percent! One hundred for camera work! One hundred plus!\u201d\\nThere is no end to my recollections of Rashomon. If I tried to write about all of them, I\u2019d never finish, so I\u2019d like to end with one incident that left an indelible impression on me. It has to do with the music.\\nAs I was writing the script, I heard the rhythms of a bolero in my head over the episode of the woman\u2019s side of the story. I asked Hayasaka to write a bolero kind of music for the scene. When we came to the dubbing of that scene, Hayasaka sat down next to me and said, \u201cI\u2019ll try it with the music.\u201d In his face I saw uneasiness and anticipation. My own nervousness and expectancy gave me a painful sensation in my chest. The screen lit up with the beginning of the scene, and the strains of the bolero music softly counted out the rhythm. As the scene progressed, the music rose, but the image and the sound failed to coincide and seemed to be at odds with each other. \u201cDamn it,\u201d I thought. The multiplication of sound and image that I had calculated in my head had failed, it seemed. It was enough to make me break out in a cold sweat.\\nWe kept going. The bolero music rose yet again, and suddenly picture and sound fell into perfect unison. The mood created was positively eerie. I felt an icy chill run down my spine, and unwittingly I turned to Hayasaka. He was looking at me. His face was pale, and I saw that he was shuddering with the same eerie emotion I felt. From that point on, sound and image proceeded with incredible speed to surpass even the calculations I had made in my head. The effect was strange and overwhelming.\\nAnd that is how Rashomon was made. During the shooting there were two fires at the Daiei studios. But because we had mobilized the fire engines for our filming, they were already primed and drilled, so the studios escaped with very minor damage.\\nAfter Rashomon I made a film of Dostoevsky\u2019s The Idiot (Hakuchi, 1951) for the Shochiku studios. This Idiot was ruinous. I clashed directly with the studio heads, and then when the reviews on the completed film came out, it was as if they were a mirror reflection of the studio\u2019s attitude toward me. Without exception, they were scathing. On the heels of this disaster, Daiei rescinded its offer for me to do another film with them.\\nI listened to this cold announcement at the Chofu studios of Daiei in the Tokyo suburbs. I walked out through the gate in the gloomy daze, and, not having the will even to get on the train, I ruminated over my bleak situation as I walked all the way home to Komae. I concluded that for some time I would have to \u201ceat cold rice\u201d and resigned myself to this fact. Deciding that it would serve no purpose to get excited about it, I set out to go fishing at the Tamagawa River. I cast my line into the river. It immediately caught on something and snapped in two. Having no replacement with me, I hurriedly put my equipment away. Thinking this was what it was like when bad luck catches up with you, I headed back home.\\nI arrived home depressed, with barely enough strength to slide open the door to the entry. Suddenly my wife came bounding out. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d I was unwittingly indignant: \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cRashomon has the Grand Prix.\u201d Rashomon had won the Grand Prix at the Venice International Film Festival, and I was spared from having to eat cold rice.\\nOnce again an angel had appeared out of nowhere. I did not even know that Rashomon had been submitted to the Venice Film Festival. The Japan representative to Italiafilm, Giuliana Stramigioli, had seen it and recommended it to Venice. It was like pouring water into the sleeping ears of the Japanese film industry.\\nLater Rashomon won the American Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Japanese critics insisted that these two prizes were simply reflections of Westerners\u2019 curiosity and taste for Oriental exoticism, which struck me then, and now, as terrible. Why is it that Japanese people have no confidence in the worth of Japan? Why do they elevate everything foreign and denigrate everything Japanese? Even the woodblock prints of Utamoro, Hokusai and Sharaku were not appreciated by Japanese until they were first discovered by the West. I don\u2019t know how to explain this lack of discernment. I can only despair of the character of my own people.\\nExcerpted from Something Like an Autobiography, trans., Audie E. Bock. Translation Copyright \u00a91982 by Vintage Books.

He came in looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified Raskolnikov\u2019s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received this \u201cspontaneous\u201d mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.\\n\u201cFool! You fiend,\u201d he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent flying and crashing.\\n\u201cBut why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it\u2019s a loss to the Crown,\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch\u2019s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing. Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the visitors\u2019 entrance and was standing in expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a certain embarrassment. Zametov\u2019s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.\\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to think of that,\u201d he thought. \u201cExcuse me, please,\u201d he began, affecting extreme embarrassment. \u201cRaskolnikov.\u201d\\n\u201cNot at all, very pleasant to see you\u2026 and how pleasantly you\u2019ve come in\u2026. Why, won\u2019t he even say good-morning?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.\\n\u201cUpon my honour I don\u2019t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only told him as we came along that he was like Romeo\u2026 and proved it. And that was all, I think!\u201d\\n\u201cPig!\u201d ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\n\u201cThere must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at the word,\u201d Porfiry laughed.\\n\u201cOh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!\u201d snapped Razumihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing had happened. \u201cThat\u2019ll do! We are all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you known each other long?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\n\u201cWhy, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,\u201d he said easily.\\n\u201cThen I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?\u201d\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight.\\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin, sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive interest.\\n\u201cFool,\u201d Raskolnikov swore to himself.\\n\u201cYou have to give information to the police,\u201d Porfiry replied, with a most businesslike air, \u201cthat having learnt of this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them\u2026 or\u2026 but they will write to you.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the point, that at the present moment,\u201d Raskolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, \u201cI am not quite in funds\u2026 and even this trifling sum is beyond me\u2026 I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have money\u2026.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s no matter,\u201d answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, \u201cbut you can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cOn an ordinary sheet of paper?\u201d Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the question.\\n\u201cOh, the most ordinary,\u201d and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov\u2019s fancy, for it all lasted but a moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\\n\u201cHe knows,\u201d flashed through his mind like lightning.\\n\u201cForgive my troubling you about such trifles,\u201d he went on, a little disconcerted, \u201cthe things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was alarmed when I heard\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!\u201d Razumihin put in with obvious intention.\\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.\\n\u201cYou seem to be jeering at me, brother?\u201d he said to him, with a well-feigned irritability. \u201cI dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn\u2019t think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the silver watch, though it\u2019s not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father\u2019s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is here,\u201d he turned suddenly to Porfiry, \u201cand if she knew,\u201d he turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, \u201cthat the watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!\u201d\\n\u201cNot a bit of it! I didn\u2019t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!\u201d shouted Razumihin distressed.\\n\u201cWas it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?\u201d Raskolnikov asked himself in a tremor. \u201cWhy did I say that about women?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, your mother is with you?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.\\n\u201cWhen did she come?\u201d\\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\\n\u201cYour things would not in any case be lost,\u201d he went on calmly and coldly. \u201cI have been expecting you here for some time.\u201d\\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin\u2019s cigarette.\\n\u201cWhat? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges there?\u201d cried Razumihin.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\\n\u201cYour things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the date on which you left them with her\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cHow observant you are!\u201d Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly added:\\n\u201cI say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges\u2026 that it must be difficult to remember them all\u2026. But you remember them all so clearly, and\u2026 and\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cStupid! Feeble!\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy did I add that?\u201d\\n\u201cBut we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn\u2019t come forward,\u201d Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.\\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been quite well.\u201d\\n\u201cI heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something. You look pale still.\u201d\\n\u201cI am not pale at all\u2026. No, I am quite well,\u201d Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. \u201cAnd in my anger I shall betray myself,\u201d flashed through his mind again. \u201cWhy are they torturing me?\u201d\\n\u201cNot quite well!\u201d Razumihin caught him up. \u201cWhat next! He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!\u201d\\n\u201cReally delirious? You don\u2019t say so!\u201d Porfiry shook his head in a womanish way.\\n\u201cNonsense! Don\u2019t you believe it! But you don\u2019t believe it anyway,\u201d Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem to catch those strange words.\\n\u201cBut how could you have gone out if you hadn\u2019t been delirious?\u201d Razumihin got hot suddenly. \u201cWhat did you go out for? What was the object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.\u201d\\n\u201cI was awfully sick of them yesterday.\u201d Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, \u201cI ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn\u2019t find me, and took a lot of money with me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.\u201d\\nHe could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his expression and his silence to him.\\n\u201cIn my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable,\u201d Zametov pronounced dryly.\\n\u201cAnd Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,\u201d put in Porfiry Petrovitch, \u201cthat he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over.\u201d\\n\u201cAnd there,\u201d said Razumihin, \u201cweren\u2019t you mad then? You gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-five at once!\u201d\\n\u201cMaybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So that\u2019s why I was liberal yesterday\u2026. Mr. Zametov knows I\u2019ve found a treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,\u201d he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. \u201cWe are boring you, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\\n\u201cOh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you interest me! It\u2019s interesting to look on and listen\u2026 and I am really glad you have come forward at last.\u201d\\n\u201cBut you might give us some tea! My throat\u2019s dry,\u201d cried Razumihin.\\n\u201cCapital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn\u2019t you like\u2026 something more essential before tea?\u201d\\n\u201cGet along with you!\u201d\\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\\nRaskolnikov\u2019s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.\\n\u201cThe worst of it is they don\u2019t disguise it; they don\u2019t care to stand on ceremony! And how if you didn\u2019t know me at all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don\u2019t care to hide that they are tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.\u201d He was shaking with rage. \u201cCome, strike me openly, don\u2019t play with me like a cat with a mouse. It\u2019s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I won\u2019t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly faces, and you\u2019ll see how I despise you.\u201d He could hardly breathe. \u201cAnd what if it\u2019s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get angry and don\u2019t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it\u2019s all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is something about them\u2026. It all might be said, but there is something. Why did he say bluntly, \u2018With her\u2019? Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone\u2026. Razumihin is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of course it\u2019s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it\u2019s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude\u2026. Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it\u2019s my first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back to him. They\u2019re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If only they\u2019d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it pass\u2026. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards\u2026. Delirious, indeed\u2026 ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last night! He didn\u2019t know of my mother\u2019s arrival! The hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won\u2019t catch me! There are no facts\u2026 it\u2019s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn\u2019t a fact but delirium. I know what to say to them\u2026. Do they know about the flat? I won\u2019t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that\u2019s right; to play the invalid\u2026. He is feeling me. He will try to catch me. Why did I come?\u201d\\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.\\n\u201cYour party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather\u2026. And I am out of sorts altogether,\u201d he began in quite a different tone, laughing to Razumihin.\\n\u201cWas it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point. Who got the best of it?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.\u201d\\n\u201cOnly fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat is there strange? It\u2019s an everyday social question,\u201d Raskolnikov answered casually.\\n\u201cThe question wasn\u2019t put quite like that,\u201d observed Porfiry.\\n\u201cNot quite, that\u2019s true,\u201d Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and hurried as usual. \u201cListen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to help me. I told them you were coming\u2026. It began with the socialist doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!...\u201d\\n\u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him more excited than ever.\\n\u201cNothing is admitted,\u201d Razumihin interrupted with heat.\\n\u201cI am not wrong. I\u2019ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them is \u2018the influence of environment,\u2019 and nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it\u2019s not supposed to exist! They don\u2019t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That\u2019s why they instinctively dislike history, \u2018nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,\u2019 and they explain it all as stupidity! That\u2019s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don\u2019t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won\u2019t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won\u2019t revolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery\u2014it wants life, it hasn\u2019t completed its vital process, it\u2019s too soon for the graveyard! You can\u2019t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to the question of comfort! That\u2019s the easiest solution of the problem! It\u2019s seductively clear and you musn\u2019t think about it. That\u2019s the great thing, you mustn\u2019t think! The whole secret of life in two pages of print!\u201d\\n\u201cNow he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!\u201d laughed Porfiry. \u201cCan you imagine,\u201d he turned to Raskolnikov, \u201csix people holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a preliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?\u201d\\n\u201cWell, strictly speaking, it did,\u201d Porfiry observed with noteworthy gravity; \u201ca crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the influence of environment.\u201d\\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. \u201cOh, if you like,\u201d he roared. \u201cI\u2019ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great\u2019s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?\u201d\\n\u201cDone! Let\u2019s hear, please, how he will prove it!\u201d\\n\u201cHe is always humbugging, confound him,\u201d cried Razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of talking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don\u2019t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!\u201d\\n\u201cAh, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.\u201d\\n\u201cAre you such a good dissembler?\u201d Raskolnikov asked carelessly.\\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. All these questions about crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time. \u2018On Crime\u2019... or something of the sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodical Review.\u201d\\n\u201cMy article? In the Periodical Review?\u201d Raskolnikov asked in astonishment. \u201cI certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the Weekly Review.\u201d\\n\u201cBut it came out in the Periodical.\u201d\\n\u201cAnd the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t printed at the time.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Review was amalgamated with the Periodical, and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn\u2019t you know?\u201d\\nRaskolnikov had not known.\\n\u201cWhy, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you directly. It\u2019s a fact, I assure you.\u201d\\n\u201cBravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!\u201d cried Razumihin. \u201cI\u2019ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn\u2019t matter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!\u201d\\n\u201cHow did you find out that the article was mine? It\u2019s only signed with an initial.\u201d\\n\u201cI only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know him\u2026. I was very much interested.\u201d\\n\u201cI analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and after the crime.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but\u2026 it was not that part of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain persons who can\u2026 that is, not precisely are able to, but have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the law is not for them.\u201d\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his idea.\\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the influence of environment?\u201d Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.\\n\u201cNo, not exactly because of it,\u201d answered Porfiry. \u201cIn his article all men are divided into \u2018ordinary\u2019 and \u2018extraordinary.\u2019 Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because, don\u2019t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat do you mean? That can\u2019t be right?\u201d Razumihin muttered in bewilderment.\\nRaskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.\\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t quite my contention,\u201d he began simply and modestly. \u201cYet I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.\u201d (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) \u201cThe only difference is that I don\u2019t contend that extraordinary people are always bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 man has the right\u2026 that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep\u2026 certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). You say that my article isn\u2019t definite; I am ready to make it as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty bound\u2026 to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all\u2026 well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed\u2014often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law\u2014were of use to their cause. It\u2019s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals\u2014more or less, of course. Otherwise it\u2019s hard for them to get out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is what they can\u2019t submit to, from their very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that it\u2019s somewhat arbitrary, but I don\u2019t insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have the gift or the talent to utter a new word. There are, of course, innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be controlled, because that\u2019s their vocation, and there is nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading through blood\u2014that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that. It\u2019s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There\u2019s no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me\u2014and _vive la guerre \u00e9ternelle_\u2014till the New Jerusalem, of course!\u201d\\n\u201cThen you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?\u201d\\n\u201cI do,\u201d Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\\n\u201cAnd\u2026 and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.\u201d\\n\u201cI do,\u201d repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\\n\u201cAnd\u2026 do you believe in Lazarus\u2019 rising from the dead?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2026 I do. Why do you ask all this?\u201d\\n\u201cYou believe it literally?\u201d\\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so\u2026. I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the contrary\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cTriumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this life, and then\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cThey begin executing other people?\u201d\\n\u201cIf it\u2019s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is very witty.\u201d\\n\u201cThank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn\u2019t they adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn\u2019t they wear something, be branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to \u2018eliminate obstacles\u2019 as you so happily expressed it, then\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cOh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.\u201d\\n\u201cNo reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, \u2018destroyers,\u2019 and to push themselves into the \u2018new movement,\u2019 and this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really new people are very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling tendencies. But I don\u2019t think there is any considerable danger here, and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course, they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even this isn\u2019t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others chastise themselves with their own hands\u2026. They will impose various public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; in fact you\u2019ve nothing to be uneasy about\u2026. It\u2019s a law of nature.\u201d\\n\u201cWell, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but there\u2019s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it\u2019s alarming if there are a great many of them, eh?\u201d\\n\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t worry about that either,\u201d Raskolnikov went on in the same tone. \u201cPeople with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps\u2014I speak roughly, approximately\u2014is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy, are you both joking?\u201d Razumihin cried at last. \u201cThere you sit, making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?\u201d\\nRaskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply. And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and discourteous sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.\\n\u201cWell, brother, if you are really serious\u2026 You are right, of course, in saying that it\u2019s not new, that it\u2019s like what we\u2019ve read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of conscience, and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism\u2026. That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that sanction of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind\u2026 more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed\u2026.\u201d\\n\u201cYou are quite right, it is more terrible,\u201d Porfiry agreed.\\n\u201cYes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it. You can\u2019t think that! I shall read it.\u201d\\n\u201cAll that is not in the article, there\u2019s only a hint of it,\u201d said Raskolnikov.\\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Porfiry couldn\u2019t sit still. \u201cYour attitude to crime is pretty clear to me now, but\u2026 excuse me for my impertinence (I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you\u2019ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but\u2026 there are various practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet\u2014a future one of course\u2014and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles\u2026. He has some great enterprise before him and needs money for it\u2026 and tries to get it\u2026 do you see?\u201d\\nZametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him.\\n\u201cI must admit,\u201d he went on calmly, \u201cthat such cases certainly must arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare; young people especially.\u201d\\n\u201cYes, you see. Well then?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d Raskolnikov smiled in reply; \u201cthat\u2019s not my fault. So it is and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin) that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There\u2019s no need to be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.\u201d\\n\u201cAnd what if we do catch him?\u201d\\n\u201cThen he gets what he deserves.\u201d\\n\u201cYou are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?\u201d\\n\u201cWhy do you care about that?\u201d\\n\u201cSimply from humanity.\u201d\\n\u201cIf he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his punishment\u2014as well as the prison.\u201d\\n\u201cBut the real geniuses,\u201d asked Razumihin frowning, \u201cthose who have the right to murder? Oughtn\u2019t they to suffer at all even for the blood they\u2019ve shed?\u201d\\n\u201cWhy the word ought? It\u2019s not a matter of permission or prohibition. He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,\u201d he added dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.\\nHe raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and he felt this. Everyone got up.\\n\u201cWell, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch began again, \u201cbut I can\u2019t resist. Allow me one little question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I want to express, simply that I may not forget it.\u201d\\n\u201cVery good, tell me your little notion,\u201d Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale and grave before him.\\n\u201cWell, you see\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how to express it properly\u2026. It\u2019s a playful, psychological idea\u2026. When you were writing your article, surely you couldn\u2019t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself\u2026 just a little, an \u2018extraordinary\u2019 man, uttering a new word in your sense\u2026. That\u2019s so, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\\n\u201cQuite possibly,\u201d Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.\\nRazumihin made a movement.\\n\u201cAnd, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity\u2014to overstep obstacles?... For instance, to rob and murder?\u201d\\nAnd again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as before.\\n\u201cIf I did I certainly should not tell you,\u201d Raskolnikov answered with defiant and haughty contempt.\\n\u201cNo, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary point of view\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cFoo! how obvious and insolent that is!\u201d Raskolnikov thought with repulsion.\\n\u201cAllow me to observe,\u201d he answered dryly, \u201cthat I don\u2019t consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.\u201d\\n\u201cOh, come, don\u2019t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?\u201d Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.\\nSomething peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.\\n\u201cPerhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona Ivanovna last week?\u201d Zametov blurted out from the corner.\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.\\n\u201cAre you going already?\u201d Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness. \u201cVery, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two\u2026 to-morrow, indeed. I shall be there at eleven o\u2019clock for certain. We\u2019ll arrange it all; we\u2019ll have a talk. As one of the last to be there, you might perhaps be able to tell us something,\u201d he added with a most good-natured expression.\\n\u201cYou want to cross-examine me officially in due form?\u201d Raskolnikov asked sharply.\\n\u201cOh, why? That\u2019s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me. I lose no opportunity, you see, and\u2026 I\u2019ve talked with all who had pledges\u2026. I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the last\u2026. Yes, by the way,\u201d he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, \u201cI just remember, what was I thinking of?\u201d he turned to Razumihin, \u201cyou were talking my ears off about that Nikolay\u2026 of course, I know, I know very well,\u201d he turned to Raskolnikov, \u201cthat the fellow is innocent, but what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too\u2026. This is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it.\\n\u201cThen when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn\u2019t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn\u2019t you notice them? It\u2019s very, very important for them.\u201d\\n\u201cPainters? No, I didn\u2019t see them,\u201d Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see them, and I don\u2019t think I noticed a flat like that open\u2026. But on the fourth storey\u201d (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) \u201cI remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna\u2019s\u2026. I remember\u2026 I remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But painters\u2026 no, I don\u2019t remember that there were any painters, and I don\u2019t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn\u2019t.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised. \u201cWhy, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you asking?\u201d\\n\u201cFoo! I have muddled it!\u201d Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead. \u201cDeuce take it! This business is turning my brain!\u201d he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. \u201cIt would be such a great thing for us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something\u2026. I quite muddled it.\u201d\\n\u201cThen you should be more careful,\u201d Razumihin observed grimly.\\nThe last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness.\\nThey went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:842792ff-9ed5-4959-9a6a-526b7eed61ac>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/182/crime-and-punishment/3410/part-3-chapter-5/\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9757550954818726, \"token_count\": 10724, \"score\": 2.609375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"The most illustrious Czars and mighty Princes, John and Peter Alexewitz, my most gracious Lords, having in their Wise Council of State resolved to send a splendid Embassy, on some important affairs, to the Great Bogdaichan, or Sovereign of the famous Kingdom of Kitai, by us Europeans commonly called China: This obliged me with a welcoming opportunity of traveling through part of the famous, but hitherto unknown, Siberian and Kitaian Countries, (never before visited by any German) and informing my self by credible witnesses of the remainder of those Lands, as well as obtaining a certain knowledge of several things with which the World hath not been hitherto acquainted.\\nEvert Ysbrants Ides was the first educated European to travel in Siberia and gather firsthand information about the collection of fossil ivory. Ides' opportunity to travel across Siberia was the direct result of the satisfactory settlement of a small war on the Chinese border.\\nThe speed with which the first wave of Russian fur traders, called promyshleniki, crossed Siberia created serious supply problems for them. Men carrying small loads of goods and supplies could easily cross Siberia using a network of rivers and short portages by boat in the summer and sled in the winter. Bringing large loads of bulky goods, specifically enough grain to feed a small settlement, was a much more difficult and expensive proposition. It could take three or four years for a shipment of grain to reach a remote place like Yakutsk and, by then, the majority of the load would be inedible. Because of this, the promyshleniki were relieved and excited when they began to hear rumors of the Amur, a valley in the south filled with grain, cattle, and silver.\\nThe first expedition to reach the Amur was a group of 132 cossacks under Vassily Poiarkov in 1643-46. The Amur natives, whom the Russians called Daurians, greeted Poiarkov with hospitality but the relationship turned sour as the Russians resorted to kidnapping, plunder, and, it is reputed, cannibalism to get what they wanted. This kind of behavior went over with the locals about as well as you might expect. Poiarkov had to fight his way out of the country and lost half of his command to native attacks and starvation. However, because he confirmed that the Amur was a land of cattle and grain (he didn't find any silver), the expedition was proclaimed a success. Several other Russians tried to map out a better route into the Amur valley. In 1651, Yerofey Khabarov fought his way down the river with even more brutality than Poiarkov had and built a fort near the site of the city that now bears his name. This is when things began to go to hell.\\nKhabarov knew, but chose to ignore, that the Amur was within the Chinese sphere of influence. What he might not have known was that it was also part of the homeland of the new Qing dynasty of China. The only reason he was able to occupy as much land as he did was that most of the armed Manchu horsemen were still busy conquering China. A year after Khabarov built Achansk, a Chinese military expedition arrived to drive him out of the valley. This was the beginning of more than thirty years of seesawing occupation of the Amur country. By the early eighties, with most of China finally pacified, the Kangxi emperor was ready to deal with the Russians once and for all. Now it was the turn of Moscow to get alarmed.\\nMoscow, in the 1680s, was infected with a bad case of \\\"who's in charge here?\\\" In April 1682, Tsar Fedor III died at the tender age of twenty one without leaving an heir. The succession fell on his brothers Ivan and Peter. The elder of the two, Ivan, was severely epileptic, nearly blind, and may have suffered from a variety of other problems (diagnosing the physical and mental health of historical figures is more of a parlor game than a science among historians). Peter was strong as an ox, but only ten years old. To further complicate matters, the two boys had different mothers and the two sets of in-laws formed powerful and antagonistic factions at court. Fedor's death was followed by a week of riot and rebellion (not all of which was related to the succession). When the dust cleared, Ivan and Peter had been declared co-tsars and their sister Sophia was the de facto regent ruling in their names.\\nExcept for a few years during the reign of Catherine the Great, historians have not been kind to Sophia. She has been reduced to cartoonish stereotype of a scheming woman (which is bad) who was finally put back in her place by a strong male (which is good). In fact, Sophia Alexeevna Romanov was an extraordinary woman. She was intelligent, well informed, and literate in three languages. She was comfortable giving orders and appearing in public at a time when most upper-class Russian women were kept in harem-like seclusion for their entire lives. During the seven years that she served as regent for the two tsars, Sophia had successes and failures no different than any other rulers\u2019. For the advance of mammoth knowledge, her most important achievement was settling the Amur conflict.\\nSince the beginning of the century, the tsars had recognized the potential for Siberia to become a private trade route to China, but every attempt at making official contact with the Chinese court had failed due to cultural misunderstandings. Despite that, the Kangxi emperor wanted to open trade with the Russians and hoped that a show of strength would be enough to drive the promyshleniki and Cossacks out of the Amur valley. In 1684 a large and well supplied Chinese army arrived on the lower Amur and began to move west driving the Russians before them. At Albazin, on the northern bend of the Amur, the Russians attempted to make a stand, but were soon defeated. The Chinese allowed the survivors to retreat, razed their fort, and moved down river to their base of operations. When word of the defeat on the Amur reached Sophia and her advisors, they quickly dispatched an envoy to make peace with the Chinese.\\nThis should have been the end of the crisis, but, before the envoy could arrive, the Siberian Russians returned to Albazin and built a new fort provoking the Chinese army to return and start a new siege. They were only saved by the arrival in Beijing of advance messengers from the embassy. The Kangxi emperor ordered his army to lift the siege and prepared his own diplomatic mission to meet the Russians. Further complications--and there are always further complications in diplomacy--delayed the meeting of the two missions until the summer of 1689. The negotiation took place at the Russian outpost of Nerchinsk on a tributary of the Amur almost 300 miles west of Albazin. Amid elaborate ceremonies by the official heads of the missions, the real negotiations were carried out in Latin by a Polish cavalry officer (for the Russians) and a French Jesuit (for the Chinese). The agreement, signed on August 27, the first formal treaty signed between China and a Western power, required the Russians to evacuate the entire Amur valley, but established formal trade through Nerchinsk.\\nSophia did not get to celebrate the Treaty of Nerchinsk. At the same time that the negotiations were wrapping up in the East, Sophia's regency was coming to an abrupt and unanticipated end in Moscow. Sophia's position had been dramatically weakened by two disastrous campaigns in the Crimea and by her half brother Peter turning seventeen in June. Amid rumors that Sophia was planning to murder Peter and rule in her own name, supporters of the two Romanovs engaged in a month of dramatic maneuvers that resulted in Peter taking control and Sophia retiring to a convent. Peter's half brother Ivan stayed on as co-tsar until his natural death seven years later.\\nWhen word of the treaty reached Peter, he accepted the terms and began planning a trade mission to Beijing. Russia had a severe shortage of literate agents who were competent to make their way through foreign cultures, which explains the necessity of hiring Latin speaking Polish cavalry officers to conduct delicate diplomatic negotiations. For his first official trade mission to China, Peter hired a German, Dutch, or possibly Danish merchant named Evert Ysbrants Ides*. Ides had been in Russia since 1677, operating his own merchant house, first in Archangel and later in Moscow. In the spring of 1692, Ides left Moscow at the head of a 400 man caravan with instructions to exchange ratifications of the treaty, determine the best items for trade, feel out official attitudes toward the treaty, and request that a Chinese envoy be sent to Moscow.\\nThe most direct route from Moscow to China is the same one that the Trans-Siberian Railway follows today, around the southern end of the Ural Mountains, across the steppe lands at the center of Eurasia, across Lake Baikal, and on to the Amur. Unfortunately, the steppe lands were controlled by Kirghiz nomads and unsafe for Russian merchants. For this reason, Ides' caravan had to take a much more roundabout path to Baikal that took them across the Urals on the same path as Ermak a century before, down the Irtysh River to its junction with the Ob, up the Ob and its tributary the Ket, to a portage into the Yenisei basin, and up the Angara River to Baikal. By October, the mission had only reached the way station of Makofskoi on the Ket portage. It was here that Ides had had his encounter with fossil mammoths.\\nAmongst the hills, which are situate North-East of [Makofskoi], and not far from hence, the Mammuts Tongues and Legs are found; as they are also particularly on the Shores of the Rivers Jenize, Trugan [Lower Tunguska], Mongamsea [Taz], Lena, and near Jakutskoi [Yakutsk], even as far as the Frozen Sea. ... I had a Person with me to China, who had annually went out in search of these Bones; he told me, as a certain truth, that he and his Companions found the Head of one of these Animals, which was discovered by the fall of such a frozen piece of Earth. As soon as he opened it, he found the greatest part of the Flesh rotten, but it was not without difficulty that they broke out his Teeth, which were placed before his Mouth, as those of the Elephants are; they also took some Bones out of his head, and afterwards came to his Fore-foot, which they cut off, and, carried part of it to the City of Trugan [Turukhansk], the Circumference of it being as large as that of the wast of an ordinary Man. The Bones of the Head appeared somewhat red, as tho' they were tinctured with Blood.\\nThis account by Ides is the first Western description of a frozen mammoth and the beginning of a scientific and popular fascination that hasn't ended over three hundred years later.\\nLocating the mammoth to which Ides' unnamed traveling companion referred is a little tricky. Makofskoi was, and still is, a small town on the western end of the portage between the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. Ides gave no indication of how far he meant when he said mammoth remains were found in the hills to the Northeast. My conclusion, based on Ides' phrase \\\"not far from hence,\\\" is that the find must have been close to Makofskoi. The explorer Adolf Nordenskiold, who traveled along the Arctic coast in the late nineteenth century, thought, because the hunter took the mammoth's foot to Turukhansk, that the find must have been close to that place. Turukhansk is 450 miles north of Makofskoi, which is not \\\"not far from hence.\\\" In Ides' day there were two major towns on the Yenesei where his companion might have sold the ivory, Turukhansk and Yeneseisk, which is only eighty miles from Makofskoi. That argues in Nordenskiold's favor. If the find was closer to Yeneseisk the only reasons the hunter would have had for going all the way to Turukhansk would have been if Turukhansk was offering a better price for ivory or if he had other business there. Without more evidence there's no way to settle the matter. If we split the difference between Makofskoi and Turukhansk we arrive at the Stony Tunguska River. Maybe the site was blown up in 1908 by the Tunguska meteorite.\\nIdes goes on to report what the locals believed about the remains.\\nConcerning this Animal there are very different reports. The Heathens of Jakuti, Tungusi, and Ostiacki, say that they continually, or at least, by reason of the very hard Frosts, mostly live under ground, where they go backwards and forwards; to confirm which they tell us, That they have often seen the Earth heaved up when one of these Beasts was on the March, and after he was past, the place sink in, and thereby make a deep Pit. They further believe, that if this Animal comes so near to the surface of the frozen Earth as to smell, or discern the Air, he immediately dies, which they say is the reason that several of them are found dead, on the high Banks of the River, where they unawares came out of the Ground. This is the opinion of the Infidels concerning these Beasts, which are never seen.\\nBut the old Siberian Russians affirm, that the Mammuth is very like the Elephant, with this only difference, that the Teeth of the former are firmer, and not so straight as those of the latter. They also are of Opinion, that there were Elephants in this Country before the Deluge, when this Climate was warmer, and that their drowned bodies floating on the Surface of the Water of that Flood, were at last wash'd and forced into Subterranean Cavities...\\nThe description of the mammoth as a subterranean animal that dies on exposure to surface air is almost identical to that given by the Chinese writer Tung-fang So in the second century BC.\\nThe three \\\"heathen\\\" tribes that Ides mentions are names given by the Russian conquerors and used to lump together all of the peoples of the Lower Irtysh, Ob, Yenisei, and Lena river basins. That is to say, he was ascribing the belief in the mammoth as a giant mole to most of the people of Western and Central Siberia. Later travelers ascribed different beliefs to many of these peoples. Still other travelers confirmed Ides' observations. When Ides traveled across Siberia, most of these peoples had been under Russian rule for a century, giving them plenty of time to have heard about the ideas of tribes with which they had had very little contact and to have learned the Biblical stories of Noah and Behemoth. Today, it is virtually impossible to sort out which tribes believed what before their contact with the Russians.\\nWhile Ides was the first educated European to travel in Siberia and report firsthand information on the collection of fossil ivory, he wouldn't be the last. Peter the Great's diplomacy, wars, economic needs, and personal curiosity would send a constant stream of educated Europeans into his Eastern realms. They in turn would send back a constant stream of information that would be eagerly consumed by a Europe that was looking at the world through an increasingly scientific lens.\\nHmmm. I still seem to be having trouble with that \\\"keep your blog posts under a thousand words\\\" thing. Oh well...\\n* Ides nationality and name have been the source of much confusion over the years. Accounts of his journey describe him variously as Dutch, German, and Danish. In the opening quote he implies that he considers himself to be German, but the first edition of his book was published in Dutch. The confusion comes from the fact that his parents were Dutch immigrants to Holstein, a German-speaking province that is the home of many cows and was then ruled by the King of Denmark. It's likely that Ides was fluent in both German and Dutch.\\nThe possible spellings given for his first and middle names are even more varied than his nationality. Because his middle name is sometimes spelled Ysbrand, some writers have assumed that he and the mission's secretary, Adam Brand, were one person. Adding to that confusion was the fact that both of them published memoirs of the journey, which the same writers who thought they were the same person assumed were merely different editions of the same book. They weren't, it wasn't, and that's that.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:53e8bab9-3a15-4496-a8db-400a8f03146a>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/03/fragments-of-my-research-viii.html\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9845748543739319, \"token_count\": 3506, \"score\": 2.828125, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

His parents Isaac Bers and Bertha Weinberg were teachers, his mother being head at an elementary school in Riga where teaching was in Yiddish while his father was head at the Yiddish high school in Riga. Born in 1914, Lipa's early years were much affected by the political and military events taking place in Russia. Latvia had been under Russian imperial rule since the 18th century so World War I meant that there were evacuations from Riga. The Russian Revolution which began in October 1917 caused fighting between the Red Army and the White Army and for the next couple of years various parts of Russia came first under the control of one faction then of the other. Lipa's family went to Petrograd, the name that St Petersburg had been given in 1914 when there was strong anti-German feeling in Russia, but Lipa was too young to understand the difficulties that his parents went through at this time.\\nAt the end of World War I in 1918, Latvia regained its independence although this was to be short-lived. Lipa spent some time back in Riga, but he also spent time in Berlin. His mother took him to Berlin while she was training at the Psychoanalytic Institute. During his schooling mathematics became his favourite subject and he decided that it was the subject he wanted to study at university. He studied at the University of Zurich, then returned to Riga and studied at the university there.\\nAt this time Europe was a place of extreme politics and, in 1934, Latvia became ruled by a dictator. Lipa was a political activist, a social democrat who argued strongly for human rights. He was at this time a soap-box orator putting his views across strongly both in speeches and in writing for an underground newspaper. Strongly opposed to dictators and strongly advocating democracy it was clear that his criticism of the Latvian dictator could not be ignored by the authorities. A warrant was issued for his arrest and, just in time, he escaped to Prague. His girl friend Mary Kagan followed him to Prague where they married on 15 May 1938.\\nThere were a number of reasons why Bers chose to go to Prague at this time. Firstly he had to escape from Latvia, secondly Prague was in a democratic country, and thirdly his aunt lived there so he could obtain permission to study at the Charles University without having to find a job to support himself. One should also not underestimate the fact that by this stage his mathematical preferences were very much in place and Karl Loewner in Prague looked the ideal supervisor.\\nIndeed Bers did obtain his doctorate which was awarded in 1938 from the Charles University of Prague where he wrote a thesis on potential theory under Karl Loewner's supervision. At the time Bers was rather unhappy with Loewner :-\\nLipa spoke of feeling neglected, perhaps even not encouraged, by Loewner and said that only in retrospect did he understand Loewner's teaching method. He gave to each of his students the amount of support needed ... It is obvious that Lipa did not appear too needy to Loewner.\\nIn 1938 Czechoslovakia became an impossible country for someone of Jewish background. Equally dangerous was the fact that Bers had no homeland since he was a wanted man in Latvia, and was a left wing academic. With little choice but to escape again, Bers fled to Paris where his daughter Ruth was born. However, the war followed him and soon the Nazi armies began occupying France. Bers applied for a visa to the USA and, while waiting to obtain permission, he wrote two papers on Green's functions and integral representations. Just days before Paris surrendered to the advancing armies, Bers and his family moved from Paris to a part of France not yet under attack from the advancing German armies. At last he received the news that he was waiting for, the issue of American visas for his family.\\nIn 1940 Bers and his family arrived in the United States and joined his mother who was already in New York. There was of course a flood of well qualified academics arriving in the United States fleeing from the Nazis and there was a great scarcity of posts, even for the most brilliant, so he was unemployed until 1942, living with other unemployed refugees in New York. During this time he continued his mathematical researches. After this he was appointed Research Instructor at Brown University where, as part of work relevant to the war effort, he studied two-dimensional subsonic fluid flow. This was important at that time since aircraft wings were being designed for planes with jet engines capable of high speeds.\\nBetween 1945 and 1949 Bers worked at Syracuse University, first at Assistant Professor, later as Associate Professor. Gelbart wanted to build up the department at Syracuse and attracting both Bers and Loewner was an excellent move. Here Bers began work on the problem of removability of singularities of non-linear elliptic equations. His major results in this area were announced by him at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950 and his paper Isolated singularities of minimal surfaces was published in the Annals of Mathematics in 1951. Courant writes:-\\nThe nonparametric differential equation of minimal surfaces may be considered the most accessible significant example revealing typical qualities of solutions of non-linear partial differential equations. With a view to such a general objective, [Bers] has studied singularities, branch-points and behaviour in the large of minimal surfaces.\\nAbikoff writes in  that this paper is:-\\n... a magnificent synthesis of complex analytic techniques which relate the different parameterisations of minimal surfaces to the representations of the potential function for subsonic flow and thereby achieves the extension across the singularity.\\nBers then became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton where he began work on Teichm\u00fcller theory, pseudoanalytic functions, quasiconformal mappings and Kleinian groups. He was set in the right direction by an inequality he found in a paper of Lavrentev who attributed the inequality to Ahlfors. In a lecture he gave in 1986 Bers explained what happened next:-\\nI was in Princeton at the time. Ahlfors came to Princeton and announced a talk on quasiconformal mappings. He spoke at the University so I went there and sure enough, he proved this theorem. So I came up to him after the talk and asked him \\\"Where did you publish it?\\\", and he said \\\"I didn't\\\". \\\"So why did Lavrentev credit you with it?\\\" Ahlfors said \\\"He probably thought I must know it and was too lazy to look it up in the literature\\\".\\nWhen Bers met Lavrentev three years later he asked him the same questions and, indeed, Ahlfors had been correct in guessing why Lavrentev had credited him. Bers continued in his 1986 lecture:-\\nI immediately decided that, first of all, if quasiconformal mappings lead to such powerful and beautiful results and, secondly, if it is done in this gentlemanly spirit - where you don't fight over priority - this is something that I should spend the rest of my life studying.\\nIt is ironic, given Bers strong political views on human rights, that he should find that Teichm\u00fcller, a fervent Nazi, had already made stunning contributions. In one of his papers on Teichm\u00fcller theory, Bers quotes Plutarch:-\\nIt does not of necessity follow that, if the work delights you with its grace, the one who wrought it is worthy of your esteem.\\nIn 1951 Bers went to the Courant Institute in New York, where he was a full professor, and remained there for 13 years. During this time he wrote a number of important books and surveys on his work. He published Theory of pseudo-analytic functions in 1953 which Protter, in a review, described as follows:-\\nThe theory of pseudo-analytic functions was first announced by [Bers] in two notes. These lecture notes not only contain proofs and extensions of the results previously announced but give a self-contained and comprehensive treatment of the subject.\\nThe author sets as his goal the development of a function theory for solutions of linear, elliptic, second order partial differential equations in two independent variables (or systems of two first-order equations). One of the chief stumbling blocks in such a task is the fact that the notion of derivative is a hereditary property for analytic functions while this is clearly not the case for solutions of general second order elliptic equations.\\nAnother classic text was Mathematical aspects of subsonic and transonic gas dynamics published in 1958:-\\nIt should be said, even though this is taken for granted by everybody in the case of Professor Bers, that the survey is masterly in its elegance and clarity.\\nIn 1958 Bers address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he lectured on Spaces of Riemann surfaces and announced a new proof of the measurable Riemann mapping theorem. In his talk Bers summarised recent work on the classical problem of moduli for compact Riemann surfaces and sketched a proof of the Teichm\u00fcller theorem characterizing extremal quasiconformal mappings. He showed that the Teichm\u00fcller space for surfaces of genus g is a (6g-6)-cell, and showed how to construct the natural complex analytic structure for the Teichm\u00fcller space.\\nBers was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1959-60, and a Fulbright Fellow in the same academic year. From 1959 until he left the Courant Institute in 1964, Bers was Chairman of the Graduate Department of Mathematics.\\nIn 1964 Bers went to Columbia University where he was to remain until he retired in 1984. He was chairman of the department from 1972 to 1975. He was appointed Davies Professor of Mathematics in 1972, becoming Emeritus Davies Professor of Mathematics in 1982. During this period Bers was Visiting Miller Research Professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1968.\\nTilla Weinstein describes in  Bers as a lecturer:-\\nLipa's courses were irresistible. He laced his lectures with humorous asides and tasty tidbits of mathematical gossip. He presented intricate proofs with impeccable clarity, pausing dramatically at the few most critical steps, giving us a chance to think for ourselves and to worry that he might not know what to do next. Then, just as the silence got uncomfortable, he would describe the single most elegant way to complete the argument.\\nJane Gilman  describes Bers' character:-\\nUnderneath the force of Bers' personality and vivacity was the force of his mathematics. His mathematics had a clarity and beauty that went beyond the actual results. He had a special gift for conceptualising things and placing them in the larger context.\\nIn  Bers life is summed up by Abikoff as follows:-\\nLipa possessed a joy of life and an optimism that is difficult to find at this time and that is sorely missed. Those of us who experienced it directly have felt an obligation to pass it on. That, in addition to the beauty of his own work, is Lipa's enduring gift to us.\\nWe have yet to say something about Bers' great passion for human rights. In fact this was anything but a sideline in his life and one could consider that he devoted himself full-time to both his mathematical work and to his work as a social reformer. Perhaps his views are most clearly expressed by quoting from an address he gave in 1984 when awarded an honorary degree by the State University of New York at Stony Brook:-\\nBy becoming a human rights activist ... you do take upon yourself certain difficult obligations. ... I believe that only a truly even-handed approach can lead to an honest, morally convincing, and effective human rights policy. A human rights activist who hates and fears communism must also care about the human rights of Latin American leftists. A human rights activist who sympathises with the revolutionary movement in Latin America must also be concerned about human rights abuses in Cuba and Nicaragua. A devout Muslim must also care about human rights of the Bahai in Iran and of the small Jewish community in Syria, while a Jew devoted to Israel must also worry about the human rights of Palestinian Arabs. And we American citizens must be particularly sensitive to human rights violations for which our government is directly or indirectly responsible, as well as to the human rights violations that occur in our own country, as they do.\\nBers received many honours for his contributions in addition to those we have mentioned above. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to the Finnish Academy of Sciences, and to the American Philosophical Society. He served the American Mathematical Society in several capacities, particularly as Vice-President (1963-65) and as President (1975-77). The American Mathematical Society awarded him their Steele Prize in 1975. He received the New York Mayor's award in Science and Technology in 1985. He was an honorary life member of the New York Academy of Sciences, and of the London Mathematical Society.\\nArticle by: J J O'Connor and E F Robertson\\nClick on this link to see a list of the Glossary entries for this page\\nList of References (5 books/articles)|\\n|Some Quotations (3)|\\n|Mathematicians born in the same country|\\n|Honours awarded to Lipman Bers|\\n(Click below for those honoured in this way)\\n|AMS Colloquium Lecturer||1971|\\n|AMS Steele Prize||1975|\\n|American Maths Society President||1975 - 1976|\\n|LMS Honorary Member||1984|\\nOther Web sites\\n|Previous||(Alphabetically)||Next||Biographies index |\\n|History Topics || Societies, honours, etc.||Famous curves |\\n|Time lines||Birthplace maps||Chronology||Search Form |\\n|Glossary index||Quotations index||Poster index |\\n|Mathematicians of the day||Anniversaries for the year|\\nJOC/EFR \u00a9 April 2002 |\\nSchool of Mathematics and Statistics|\\nUniversity of St Andrews, Scotland\\nThe URL of this page is:|\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:8e3ce5d6-a76b-4e22-8892-e1280e29f3f7>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Bers.html\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9804872274398804, \"token_count\": 2948, \"score\": 3.0, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

There was little disagreement about the memory of the murdered martyrs... concerning celebrations of Liberation Day there were differences among groups within She'arit Hapleta, but the victors were those whose psychology had already been influenced by the positive dialectic of the future. Most members of the Central Committee supported the declaration of \\\"a memorial day combined with the liberation, which must express our grief and bitterness over the great tragedy of European Jewry, and simultaneously be a day of thanksgiving, which will be celebrated as a national symbol and will emphasize that the Jewish people still lives\\\".

"{\"text\": \"DEPUTIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE\\nDEPUTIES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, representatives of Jewish communities in Russia to the government during the reign of *Alexander I (1801\u201325). After parts of *Poland-Lithuania had been annexed by Russia, the large communities sent shtadlanim to the court at St. Petersburg to represent them and defend their rights. Most of the shtadlanim were merchants or contractors who visited the city on business. When a committee was set up to frame a \\\"Jewish constitution\\\" in 1802\u201304 it was joined by several government-appointed Jewish advisers (N.N. *Notkin, A. *Peretz, and J.L. *Nevakhovich). The government also requested some important communities to send representatives to the committee. Together they tried to influence the committee in favor of Jewish rights. In 1807 the government appointed a \\\"Jewish committee\\\" to implement the inimical \\\"Jewish constitution\\\" of 1804 and proposed that the communities elect deputies to represent the Jews before the provincial governors. The memoranda of these deputies were referred to the \\\"Jewish committee\\\" in St. Petersburg and were influential in obtaining a temporary halt to the expulsion of Jews from the villages. It was also proposed to abolish the prohibition on the lease and sale of alcohol by Jews. During the invasion by Napoleon two \\\"deputies of the Jewish people,\\\" Zundel Sonnenberg and Eliezer Dillon, accompanied Alexander's military headquarters in 1812\u201313, and acted as liaison between the czar and the large Jewish population in the combat area. They regularly presented memoranda and petitions concerning Jewish affairs to the court and transmitted its instructions to the Jewish communities. After the war an attempt was made to convert the committee of deputies into a permanent institution. The Jewish communities were requested to send representatives to St. Petersburg to maintain permanent contact with the ministries of religious affairs and popular education. On August 19, 1818, electors from the 12 districts (gubernia) of the *Pale of Settlement convened and elected three deputies, Zundel Sonnenberg, Beinush Lapkovski, and Michael Eisenstadt, and three deputy representatives. In order to raise funds to cover their expenses, which probably also included furnishing bribes, the assembly resolved that every Jew was to donate the silver headpiece of his prayer shawl. The change in Alexander's policy toward the Jews at the end of his reign reduced the importance and status of the deputies. Sonnenberg was dismissed because of \\\"impudence toward the authorities.\\\" In 1825 the Jewish deputation was officially suspended \\\"until the need arises for a new deputation,\\\" and the institution was thereby abolished and not renewed. However, the government continued to make use of Jewish representatives. In 1840 consultative committees, chosen from among \\\"enlightened\\\" Jews, were created and attached to governors in Kiev and five other towns. In 1844 the function of \\\"Learned Jew\\\" (uchoni yevrei) was created, meaning an expertand consultant in Jewish religious affairs attached to the district governers and responsible for education and interior affairs.\\nJ.I.

"{\"text\": \"Judaic Treasures of the\\nJerusalem was and remains the holiest of cities in the Holy Land, but Jews also gave a measure of holiness to three other cities there: Hebron, Safed, and Tiberias. The holiness of Jerusalem arises in part from what remains there, but more from what took place there. So it is with its sister cities. Hebron is where the patriarchs and matriarchs lived and are buried, and it was the first capital of King David. Tiberias, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, was chosen by the patriarch of the Jews in the second century as his seat. The Palestinian Talmud was largely composed in its great rabbinical academy. in the environs of Safed, high in the Galilean hills, are the graves of the leading rabbis of late antiquity. Its stature as a holy city was enhanced in the sixteenth century, when it was the greatest center of Jewish mysticism and seat of Jewish legal scholarship. To gain entree into the company of the three more ancient holy cities, it called itself Beth-El, suggesting identity with the biblical site which Jacob called \\\"The Gate of Heaven.\\\"\\nA striking pastel-colored manuscript \\\"holy site map\\\" links these four holy cities together. Drawn and painted in Palestine in the second half of the nineteenth century, it depicts those venues which indicate their holiness. There is a suggestion of their geographic positioning, but the \\\"map\\\" is far more a statement of the place these cities hold in Jewish veneration, than of the geographical site they occupy. To pious Jewish families, such wall plaques were more meaningful depictions of the Holy Land than the most aesthetically beautiful and topographically exact representations.\\nA small illustrated guide book to the burial places of biblical figures and saintly rabbis in the Holy Land, Zikaron Birushalayim, appeared in Constantinople in 1743. It tells the pious pilgrim where graves may be found and what prayers are to be said. Prefaced by a panegyric to the land, it cites a midrashic statement that, in time to come, when Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, three walls-one of silver, one of gold, and the innermost of multicolored precious stones-will encompass the dazzling city.\\nIn Hebron the pilgrim is not only directed to the holy grave sites, but also regaled with wondrous tales. One tells of a sexton of the community sent down to search for a ring which had fallen to the depths of the patriarchs' burial cave, finding at the floor of the cave three ancient men seated on chairs, engaged in study. He greets them; they return his greetings, give him the ring, and instruct him not to disclose what he had learned. When he ascended and was asked what he had seen, he replied: \\\"Three elders sitting on chairs. As for the rest, I am not permitted to tell.\\\"\\nFor actual pilgrims, the little volume provided factual information. For pilgrims in their own imagination, it offered edification through tales and quaint illustrations. The last page has a woodcut of Jericho, a seven-walled city, below which a man surrounded by a multitude is sounding a shofar. The most striking woodcut is of an imposing building, representing the Temple in Jerusalem.\\nIn the concentric circles of holiness cited in the Tanhuma, Jerusalem is at the center of the Holy Land; the Temple at the center of Jerusalem; and the Holy of Holies at the center of the Holy Temple. The Temple is prominently featured in illustrated books about the Holy Land. In A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine, three chapters describe and three engravings portray the Temple. Early Hebrew books are quite poor in illustrations, because relatively few deal with subjects that demand visual presentation.\\nAmong these are books dealing with laws concerning the Temple, and since its architecture and vessels are pertinent to the laws, they invite illustration. A case in point is Sefer Hanukat Ha-Bayit by Moses (Hefez) Gentili (1663-1711), published in Venice in 1696. A treatise on the building of the Second Temple, it abounds in engraved architectural illustrations, including a menorah, the seven-branched candlestick; most notable is a large pull-out map of the Temple, identifying fifty-eight components of the Temple's structure. The engravings were added after the printing, as was the map, and a copy containing both is rare.\\nMoses Gentili, born in Trieste, lived in Venice where he taught Talmud and Midrash, and perhaps philosophy and science as well. His best-known work, Melekhet Mahashevet, Venice, 1710, a commentary on the Pentateuch, contains a picture of the author, a clean-shaven, ministerial-looking gentleman.\\nThere are many published descriptions and illustrations of the Temple's appearance in many languages. Some are based on careful study of the available sources, others are creations of the imagination, generally inspired by the grandest building the artist knew. A plan of the Temple to be is found at the end of the 1789 Grodno edition of Zurat Beit Ha-Mikdash (The Form of the Holy Temple) by Yom Tov Lipmann Heller (1579-1654), one of the major figures in Jewish scholarship in the first half of the seventeenth century. The book is one of Heller's earliest works and is a projection of the plan of the Temple as envisaged in the prophecy of Ezekiel.\\nWe have thus traversed the Holy Land and glimpsed its holy places, past, present, and future.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:2fda8e5f-0260-44ff-b050-ac0449bb2e80>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/loc/Holy1.html\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9664288759231567, \"token_count\": 1177, \"score\": 3.4375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
