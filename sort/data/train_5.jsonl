"{\"text\": \"You Baby's Development\\nAfter many weeks of anticipation and preparation, your baby is here! Or maybe not \u2014 only 5% of women deliver on their estimated due dates, and many first-time mothers find themselves waiting up to 2 weeks after their due date for their baby to arrive.\\nA baby born at 40 weeks weighs, on average, about 7 pounds, 4 ounces (3,300 grams) and measures about 20 inches (51 cm). Don't expect your baby to look like the Gerber baby right off the bat \u2014 newborns often have heads temporarily misshapen from the birth canal and may be covered with vernix and blood. Your baby's skin may have skin discolorations, dry patches, and rashes \u2014 these many variations are completely normal.\\nBecause of the presence of your hormones in your baby's system, your baby's genitals (scrotum in boys and labia in girls) may appear enlarged. Your baby, whether a boy or a girl, may even secrete milk from the tiny nipples. This should disappear in a few days and is completely normal.\\nRight after birth, your health care provider will suction mucus out of your baby's mouth and nose, and you'll hear that long-awaited first cry. Your baby may then be placed on your stomach, and the umbilical cord will be cut \u2014 often by the baby's dad, if he chooses to do the honors! A series of quick screening tests, such as the Apgar score, will be performed to assess your baby's responsiveness and vital signs, and he or she will be weighed and measured. If your pregnancy was high risk, or if a cesarean section was necessary, a neonatologist (a doctor who specializes in newborn intensive care) will be present at your delivery to take care of your baby right away. If your baby needs any special care to adjust to life outside the womb, it will be given \u2014 and then your newborn will be placed in your waiting arms.\\nThis week you'll experience the moment you've been anticipating \u2014 your introduction to your baby! Before you can meet your baby, though, you have to go through labor and delivery. You may have learned about the three stages of birth in your prenatal classes. The first stage of labor works to thin and stretch your cervix by contracting your uterus at regular intervals. The second stage of labor is when you push your baby into the vaginal canal and out of your body. The third and final stage of labor is when you deliver the placenta.\\nIf you don't go into labor within a week of your due date, your health care provider may recommend you receive a nonstress test, which monitors fetal heart rate and movement to be sure that the baby is receiving adequate oxygen and that the nervous system is responding. Talk to your health care provider to find out more about this test.\\nSometimes mother nature may need a little coaxing. If your labor isn't progressing, or if your health or your baby's health requires it, your health care provider may induce labor by artificially rupturing the membranes or by administering the hormone oxytocin or other medications. If your pregnancy is high risk, or if there are any other potential complications, you may require a cesarean section delivery.\\nSome women know ahead of time that they will be delivering via cesarean section and are able to schedule their baby's \\\"birth day\\\" well in advance. If you're one of them, you've probably been able to prepare yourself emotionally and mentally for the birth \u2014 which can help to lessen the feelings of disappointment that many mothers who are unable to deliver vaginally experience. But even if you have to undergo a cesarean section that wasn't planned, rest assured that you'll still be able to bond with your baby. It might not be the birth experience you imagined, but your beautiful newborn has arrived nonetheless.

These foods include:\\n- Finger sandwiches\\n- Cheese chunks\\n- Fruit salad\\n- Foods that contain dairy products\\nPlan a bacteria-free buffet with these helpful tips:\\nIf you're planning a buffet at home and are not sure how quickly the food will be eaten, keep buffet portions small. Prepare a number of small platters and dishes ahead of time. Store cold back-up dishes in the refrigerator or keep hot dishes in the oven set at 200\u00b0 F to 250\u00b0 F (-73\u00b0 C to -23\u00b0 C) prior to serving. This way, your late-arriving guests can enjoy the same appetizing arrangements as the early arrivals.\\nHot foods should be kept at an internal temperature of 140\u00b0 F (60\u00b0 C) or warmer. Use a food thermometer to check. Serve or keep food hot in chafing dishes, crock pots, and warming trays. Note: Some warmers only hold food at 110\u00b0 F to 120\u00b0 F (-163\u00b0 C to -153\u00b0 C), so check the product label to make sure your warmer has the capability to hold foods at 140\u00b0 F or warmer.\\nCold foods should be kept at 40\u00b0 F (4 \u00b0 C) or colder. Keep cold foods refrigerated until serving time. If food is going to stay out on the buffet table longer than two hours, place plates of cold food on ice to retain the chill.\\nKeep It Fresh\\nDon't add new food to an already-filled serving dish. Instead, replace nearly-empty serving dishes with freshly-filled ones. Bacteria from people's hands may have contaminated the food. Plus, bacteria may have started to multiply at room temperature.\\nWatch the Clock\\nRemember the 2-Hour Rule: Discard any perishables left out at room temperature for more than two hours, unless you're keeping it hot or cold. If the buffet is held in a place where the temperature is above 90\u00b0F, the safe-holding time is reduced to one hour.\\nLeaving with Leftovers?\\nBe sure to refrigerate leftovers immediately after you arrive home.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:942da8bb-7c73-4c1b-968e-adea42d1c804>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/PeopleAtRisk/ucm083680.htm\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9088973999023438, \"token_count\": 1269, \"score\": 2.859375, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

"{\"text\": \"Young Kids May Be Able to Unbuckle Car Seats\\nSurvey of Parents Finds Some Kids May Be Unbuckling While Car Is in Motion\\nMay 2, 2011 -- Children as young as 1 year old can unbuckle themselves from car safety seats, a new survey of parents finds.\\n\\\"We found that children can unbuckle from their child car safety seats by their fourth birthday, and there is an alarming 43% who do so when the car is in motion,\\\" says researcher Lilia Reyes, MD, a clinical fellow in pediatric emergency medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven. \\\"It was reported as early as 12 months.\\\"\\nThe findings are being presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting in Denver.\\nChild Car Seats: How Secure?\\nWhile working in the pediatric emergency room at Yale, Reyes encountered two different mothers who had minor car accidents. They told her it happened when they turned their heads around after discovering their kids had unbuckled themselves.\\nTrying to determine how frequently it happened, she and her colleagues from Yale surveyed 378 parents of young children. Among the other findings:\\n- 51% or about 191 families reported that at least one of their children had unbuckled their car seats. Of these, 75% were age 3 or younger. The youngest was 12 months old.\\n- Boys unbuckled more than girls; 59% of the kids who unbuckled were boys.\\nParents were not asked if they were sure they had buckled correctly, Reyes tells WebMD. So there is a possibility the children weren't buckled in correctly. But parents do typically hear a click, like a seat safety belt, when the buckle latches, she says.\\nThe problem, she says, is that while children may be able to physically unbuckle the seat, they are just beginning, at around age 3, to develop reasoning skills to appreciate the consequences of unbuckling.\\nParents used seats of various types. They included the five-point harness, convertible seats, and booster seats, depending on their child's age and weight.\\nAre Car Seats Really Buckled?\\n''This study raises questions about how the child restraint was used,\\\" says Lorrie Walker, training manager and technical advisor for Safe Kids USA, an advocacy group.\\n\\\"Federal motor vehicle safety standard 213 requires the buckle to release using between 9 and 14 pounds of pressure,\\\" she says. \\\"It is often challenging for an adult to unbuckle the harness.\\\"\\nShe wonders if the buckle was not adequately locked in some cases.\\n\\\"A buckle may give the appearance of being buckled when it has not completely latched,\\\" she tells WebMD.\\nAmong the mistakes many parents make when placing a child in a car seat she says, is to loosely attach the harness straps or place the straps in the wrong harness slots.\\nIf these mistakes occur, she says, it makes it easy for a child to climb out.\\nThe finding that a child as young as age 1 could unbuckle the seat is a surprise to Jennifer Stockburger, program manager of vehicle and child safety for Consumer Reports. She reviewed the findings for WebMD but was not involved in the study.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:bf010e52-2673-4816-a6a6-269d9a7121ee>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://children.webmd.com/news/20110429/young-kids-may-be-able-to-unbuckle-car-seats\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9828870892524719, \"token_count\": 653, \"score\": 2.78125, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
"{\"text\": \"Published: Oct. 17, 2006\\nUpdated: Apr. 20, 2010\\nTwo-and-a-half-year-old Nina was bright-eyed and bouncy, full of laughter and hugs -- when you could get her attention. She often seemed to be ignoring her parents when they spoke to her, and when she did respond, many of her words were slurred.\\nConcerned, her parents arranged for a hearing test -- and learned that Nina had moderate hearing loss in both ears. Outfitted with a hearing aid, and provided with speech therapy, she is just beginning to regain some of the ground she lost during the first years of life when important language skills are being learned.\\n\\\"Hearing impairment is the largest congenital disability, affecting about six out of every 1,000 infants,\\\" says Duke pediatric audiologist Ann Mabie. \\\"For a very long time, people thought you couldn't test infants' hearing, and would just wait until children were two or three years old. But by the time you wait for children not to talk, a window of opportunity has shut.\\\"\\nIn fact, those tiny, shell-like ears that parents marvel over when getting to know their new babies are just the most visible parts of a highly sophisticated machine. Human infants spend the first year of life learning about their environment, and by one year of age, already understand far more language than they are yet able to use -- unless an undiagnosed hearing impairment disrupts the process.\\nWhile hearing impairments are difficult at any age, they\u2019re especially devastating in young children, because their brains rely on auditory stimulation to develop the capacity for oral communication. This makes early diagnosis and treatment of childhood hearing losses essential.\\nHappily, all newborns in North Carolina now have access to the specialized screening needed to diagnose infants with hearing loss, thanks to state legislation passed in October 1999.\\nEven babies born with normal hearing, however, can develop a hearing loss later in infancy or childhood, due to ear infections or head injuries. So parents should be aware of clues that their children might have difficulty hearing and insist on tests if they suspect hearing loss (see below).\\nMabie urges all parents who suspect that their child might have a hearing problem to get the child tested by an audiologist or physician with expertise in this area as soon as possible: \\\"Every day you wait is a day lost.\\\"\\nHearing impairments caused by problems in the middle and outer ear can sometimes be treated medically. For impairments originating in the inner ear, a hearing aid and speech therapy can help. \\\"Hearing aids help provide access to speech, and with some intensive speech and language therapy, hearing-impaired kids will do fine in a normal classroom.\\\"\\nChildren with severe to profound hearing impairments typically will require more extensive rehabilitation, and cochlear implantation may be indicated. At Duke, otolaryngologists have begun using sophisticated new technologies to help even tiny children with hearing impairments to interact with the hearing world.\\nWhen Lauren, a two-month-old infant from western North Carolina, was diagnosed with profound hearing loss due to a malformation in her inner ears, or cochleas, she was immediately fitted with hearing aids. Shortly before her second birthday, she came to Duke for a cochlear implant.\\nDuke specialists in speech pathology and audiology worked to perform a detailed evaluation of Lauren\u2019s hearing loss, using the most precise diagnostic technologies available. Duke neurotologist (ear specialist) Debara Tucci, MD, then selected the cochlear implant that would be most appropriate for Lauren.\\nAfter Tucci surgically implanted the mechanism -- a marvel of micro-engineering -- into Lauren\u2019s inner ear, the tiny computer chip that controls the implant was carefully adjusted to transmit just the right auditory signals to Lauren\u2019s brain. The result is a girl who is learning how to communicate with those around her right on schedule.\\nWhatever intervention a child with hearing deficiencies may need, time is of the essence. As the mother of one hearing-impaired child puts it, \\\"Once you find out and take action, things only get better, not worse.\u201d\\nIf your child exhibits any of the following behaviors, have him or her checked by a professional audiologist or physician with expertise in hearing disorders.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:2e03df66-fa9b-468c-9fa8-487fd46503ea>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.dukehealth.org/health_library/health_articles/hear_hear/\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9694573283195496, \"token_count\": 888, \"score\": 3.125, \"int_score\": 3}\n"

"{\"text\": \"- Exam wrappers. As David Thompson describes the process, \\\"exam wrappers required students to reflect on their performance before and after seeing their graded tests.\\\" The first four questions, completed just prior to receiving their graded test, asked students to report the time they spent preparing for the test, their methods of preparation, and their predicted test grade. After reviewing their graded test, students completed the final three reflection questions, including a categorization of test mistakes and a list of changes to implement in preparation for the next test. Thompson then collected and made copies of the wrappers returned them to the students several days later, reminding them to consider what they planned to do differently or the same in preparation for the upcoming test. Thompson reports that each reflection exercise required only 8-10 minutes of class time. Clara Hardy and others also describes uses exam wrappers.\\n- Reading Reflections. As Karl Wirth writes, reading reflections, effectively outlined by David Bressoud (2008), are designed to address some of the challenges students face with college-level reading assignments. Students submit online reading reflections (e.g., using Moodle or Blackboard) after completing each reading assignment and before coming to class. In each reflection, students summarize the important concepts of the reading and describe what was interesting, surprising, or confusing to them. The reading reflections not only encourage students to read regularly before class, but they also promote content mastery and foster student development of monitoring, self-evaluation, and reflection skills. For the instructor, reading reflections facilitate \\\"just-in-time\\\" teaching and provide invaluable insights into student thinking and learning. According to Wirth, expert readers are skilled at using a wide range of strategies during all phases of reading (e.g., setting goals for learning, monitoring comprehension during reading, checking comprehension, and self-reflection), but most college instruction simply assumes the mastery of such metacognitive skills.\\n- Knowledge surveys. Many members of the group were influenced by Karl Wirth's work on \\\"knowledge surveys\\\" as a central strategy for helping students think about their thinking. Knowledge surveys involve simple self-reports from students about their knowledge of course concepts and content. In knowledge surveys, students are presented with different facets of course content and are asked to indicate whether they know the answer, know some of the answer, or don't know the answer. Faculty can use these reports to gauge how confident students feel in their understanding of course material at the beginning or end of a course, before exams or papers, or even as graduating seniors or alumni.\\nKristin Bonnie's report relates how her students completed a short knowledge survey (6-12 questions) online (via Google forms) on the material covered in class that week. Rather than providing the answer to each question, students indicated their confidence in their ability to answer the question correctly (I know; I think I know; I don't know). Students received a small amount of credit for completing the knowledge survey. She used the information to review material that students seemed to struggle with. In addition, a subset of these questions appeared on their exam \u2013 the knowledge survey therefore served as a review sheet.Wirth notes that the surveys need not take much class time and can be administered via paper or the web. The surveys can be significant for clarifying course objectives, structure, and design. For students, knowledge surveys achieve several purposes: they help make clear course objectives and expectations, are useful as study guides, can serve as a formative assessment tool, and, perhaps most critically, aid in their development of self-assessment and metacognitive skills. For instructors, the surveys help them assess learning gains, instructional practices, and course design.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:9d6abf05-e21c-4917-ab95-cb9f3fd306aa>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://serc.carleton.edu/acm_teagle/interventions\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9568482041358948, \"token_count\": 746, \"score\": 3.578125, \"int_score\": 4}\n"

"{\"text\": \"Marion Levine teaches English, Literature and Film Production at Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, Los Angeles, CA\\nMeasure for Measure, Act 4 or 5\\nWhat's On for Today and Why\\nStudents will choose a character from Measure for Measure and create a \\\"back story\\\" for that character. This will encourage students to read the text closely looking for clues regarding a specific character's history. Students will re-read a portion of the text and then write about what has happened to the character before the play begins. They will then create an artifact, such as a diary or journal entry, written by the charcacter they have selected. This will allow them the opportunity to think like the character and to view the events of the play from a specific point of view.\\nThis lesson will take two 40 minute class periods.\\nWhat You Need\\nMeasure for Measure, Folger Edition\\nWhat To Do\\n1. Explain the concept of a \\\"back story\\\" as the important events that occur to a character before the play begins. You may need to prompt students with questions such as:\\nWhat was the character like as a child?\\nIn what situation did he/she grow up?\\nStudents will need to show how the script supports their choices.\\n2. Have the students write a one or two page back story in either the first or third person.\\n3. Divide students into small groups of 4 or 5 and have them re-read Act 4 or Act 5, combing throught the text for character details.\\n4. Have students write a letter, diary or journal entry from their selected characters point of view (first person). This artifact should concern one or more characters in the play.\\n5. For increased authenticity, appropriate for an \\\"Extra-Extended\\\" book, students could write their letter, diary entry using calligraphy, a handwriting font or on a piece of yellowed paper.\\n6. Allow students time to read their pieces and share their artifacts with the class.\\nHow Did It Go?\\nWere students able to justify their choices with reference to the text? Did their artifacts accurately portray character traits that can be interpreted from the text? Were students able to convey a sense of the character's perspective through this activity?\\nThis lesson could be applied to any fictional text that the students read in class. Through close reading and attention to a specific character, students are able to identify with, and understand the concerns of a character on a deeper level. Possible choices could include Jay Gatsby, Hester Prynne,and Atticus Finch.\\nIf you used this lesson, we would like to hear how it went and about any adaptations you made to suit the needs of YOUR students.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:86849ab7-4070-40ee-9f28-f23c0e6d4e97>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://folger.edu/eduLesPlanDtl.cfm?lpid=863\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9481241106987, \"token_count\": 553, \"score\": 4.0625, \"int_score\": 4}\n"

"{\"text\": \"Download source - 8 Kb\\nThis tutorial is based off of the MSDN Article #ID: Q194873. But, for a beginner, following these MSDN articles can be intimidating to say the least. One of the most often asked questions I see as a Visual C++ and Visual Basic programmer is how to call a VB DLL from VC++. Well, I am hoping to show you exactly that today. I am not going to go over the basic details of COM as this would take too long, so I am assuming you have an understanding of VB, VC++ and a little COM knowledge. It's not too hard to learn; just takes a little time. So let's get started.\\nThe first thing you need to do is fire up Visual Basic 6 (VB 5 should work as well). With VB running, create a new \\\"ActiveX DLL\\\" project. Rename the project to \\\"vbTestCOM\\\" and the class to \\\"clsTestClass\\\". You can do this by clicking in the VB Project Explorer Window on the Project1 item (Step 1), then clicking in the Properties window and selecting the name property (Step 2). Do the same for the Class. Click on the class (Step 3), then the name property and enter the name mentioned above (Step 4). Your project so far should look like the folowing right hand side picture:\\nOk, now we are ready to add some code to the VB Class. Click on the \\\"Tools\\\" menu, then select the \\\"Add Procedure\\\" menu item. The Add Procedure window will open up. In this window we need to add some information. First (Step 1) make sure the type is set to Function. Second (Step 2) enter a Function name called \\\"CountStringLength\\\". Finally hit the Ok button and VB will generate the new function in the class.\\nYou should have an empty function with which to work. The first thing we will do is specify a return type and an input parameter. Edit your code to look like this:\\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\\nWhat are we doing here? We are taking one parameter, as a String type in this case, then returning the length through the return type, which is a Long. We specify the input parameter as ByVal, meaning VB will make a copy of this variable and use the copy in the function, rather than the default ByRef, which passes the variable by reference. This way we can be sure that we do not modify the string by accident that was passed to us by the calling program. Let's add the code now.\\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\\nIf strValue = vbNullString Then\\nCountStringLength = 0\\nCountStringLength = Len(strValue)\\nIn the first line of code we are checking to see if the calling program passed us an empty, or NULL, string. If so we return 0 as the length. If the user did pass something other than an empty string, then we count it's length and return the length back to the calling program.\\nNow would be a good time to save your project. Accept the default names and put it in a safe directory. We need to compile this project now. Go to the File menu and select the \\\"Make vbCOMTest.dll...\\\" menu item.\\nThe compiler will produce a file called surprisingly enough: vbCOMTest.dll. The compiler will also do us the favor of entering this new DLL into the system registry. We have finished the VB side of this project, so let's start the VC++ side of it. Fire up a copy of VC++, then select from the menu, \\\"New Project\\\". The New Project window should appear. Select a \\\"Win32 Console Application\\\" (Step 1), then give it a name of \\\"TestVBCOM\\\" (Step 2). Finally, enter a directory you want to build this project in (Step 3 - your directory will vary from what I have entered).\\nClick on the \\\"OK\\\" button and the \\\"Win32 Console Application - Step 1 of 1\\\" window will appear. Leave everything on this page as the default, and click the \\\"Finish\\\" button. One final window will appear after this titled \\\"New Project Information\\\". Simply click the \\\"Ok\\\" button here. You should now have an empty Win32 Console project. Press the \\\"Ctrl\\\" and hit the \\\"N\\\" key. Another window titled \\\"New\\\" will appear. Select the \\\"C++ Source File\\\" (Step 1), then enter the new name for this file called, \\\"TestVBCOM.cpp\\\" (Step 2 - make sure the Add to Project checkbox is checked and the correct project name is in the drop down combo box), then click the \\\"Ok\\\" button to finish.\\nNow we are going to get fancy!\\nYou need to go to your Start Menu in Windows and navigate to the \\\"Visual Studio 6\\\" menu and go into the \\\"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Tools\\\" sub-menu. In here you will see an icon with the name \\\"OLE View\\\". Click on it.\\nThe OLE View tool will open up. You will see a window similar to this one:\\nCollapse all the trees, if they are not already. This will make it easier to navigate to where we want to go. Highlight the \\\"Type Libraries\\\" (Step 1) and expand it. You should see a fairly massive listing. We need to locate our VB DLL. Now, remember what we named the project? Right, we need to look for vbTestCOM. Scroll down until you find this. Once you have found it, double click on it. A new window should appear - the \\\"ITypeLib Viewer\\\" window. We are only interested in the IDL (Interface Definition Language) code on the right side of the window. Select the entire IDL text and hit the \\\"Ctrl\\\" and \\\"C\\\" buttons to copy it to the clipboard.\\nYou can close this window and the OLE View window now as we are done with the tool. We need to add the contents of the IDL file into our VC++ project folder. Go to the folder you told VC++ to create your project in and create a new text file there (If you are in Windows Explorer, you can right click in the directory and select \\\"New\\\" then scroll over following the arrow and select \\\"Text Document\\\"). Rename the text document to \\\"vbCOMTEST.idl\\\". Then double click on the new IDL file (VC++ should open it if you named it correctly with an IDL extension). Now paste the code in the file by pressing the \\\"Ctrl\\\" and \\\"V\\\" keys. The IDL text should be pasted into the file. So far, so good. Now, this IDL file is not going to do us much good until we compile it. That way, VC++ can use the files it generates to talk to the VB DLL. Let's do that now. Open a DOS window and navigate to the directory you created your VC++ project in. Once in that directory, at the prompt you need to type the following to invoke the MIDL compiler:\\nE:\\\\VCSource\\\\TestVBCOM\\\\TestVBCOM\\\\midl vbTestCOM.idl /h vbTestCOM.h\\nHit the \\\"Enter\\\" key and let MIDL do its magic. You should see results similar to the following:\\nClose the DOS window and head back into VC++. We need to add the newly generated vbTestCOM.h and vbTestCOM_i.c files to the project. You can do this by going to the \\\"Project\\\" menu, then selecting the \\\"Add to Project\\\" item, and scrolling over to the \\\"Files\\\" menu item and clicking on it. A window titled, \\\"Insert Files into Project\\\" will open. Select the two files highlighted in the next picture, then select the \\\"Ok\\\" button.\\nThese two files were generated by MIDL for us, and VC++ needs them in order to talk to the VB DLL (actually VC++ does not need the \\\"vbCOMTest_i.c\\\" file in the project, but it is handy have in the project to review). We are going to add the following code to the \\\"TestVBCOM.cpp\\\" file now, so navigate to that file in VC++ using the \\\"Workspace\\\" window.

"{\"text\": \"Basic Use To make a new number, a simple initialization suffices:\\nvar foo = 0; // or whatever number you want\\nfoo = 1; //foo = 1 foo += 2; //foo = 3 (the two gets added on) foo -= 2; //foo = 1 (the two gets removed)\\nNumber literals define the number value. In particular: They appear as a set of digits of varying length. Negative literal numbers have a minus sign before the set of digits. Floating point literal numbers contain one decimal point, and may optionally use the E notation with the character e. An integer literal may be prepended with \\\"0\\\", to indicate that a number is in base-8. (8 and 9 are not octal digits, and if found, cause the integer to be read in the normal base-10). An integer literal may also be found with \\\"0x\\\", to indicate a hexadecimal number. The Math Object Unlike strings, arrays, and dates, the numbers aren't objects.

"{\"text\": \"Twenty Ideas for Engaging ProjectsSeptember 12, 2011 | Suzie Boss\\nThe start of the school year offers an ideal time to introduce students to project-based learning. By starting with engaging projects, you'll grab their interest while establishing a solid foundation of important skills, such as knowing how to conduct research, engage experts, and collaborate with peers. In honor of Edutopia's 20th anniversary, here are 20 project ideas to get learning off to a good start.\\n1. Flat Stanley Refresh: Flat Stanley literacy projects are perennial favorites for inspiring students to communicate and connect, often across great distances. Now Flat Stanley has his own apps for iPhone and iPad, along with new online resources. Project founder Dale Hubert is recently retired from the classroom, but he's still generating fresh ideas to bring learning alive in the \\\"flatlands.\\\"\\n2. PBL is No Accident: In West Virginia, project-based learning has been adopted as a statewide strategy for improving teaching and learning. Teachers don't have to look far to find good project ideas. In this CNN story about the state's educational approach, read about a project that grew out of a fender-bender in a school parking lot. When students were asked to come up with a better design for the lot, they applied their understanding of geometry, civics, law, engineering, and public speaking. Find more good ideas in West Virginia's Teach21 project library.\\n3. Defy Gravity: Give your students a chance to investigate what happens near zero gravity by challenging them to design an experiment for NASA to conduct at its 2.2 second drop tower in Brookpark, Ohio. Separate NASA programs are offered for middle school and high school. Or, propose a project that may land you a seat on the ultimate roller coaster (aka: the \\\"vomit comet\\\"), NASA aircraft that produces periods of micro and hyper gravity ranging from 0 to 2 g's. Proposal deadline is Sept. 21, and flight week takes place in February 2012.\\n4. Connect Across Disciplines: When students design and build kinetic sculptures, they expand their understanding of art, history, engineering, language arts, and technology. Get some interdisciplinary project insights from the Edutopia video, Kinetic Conundrum. Click on the accompanying links for more tips about how you can do it, too.\\n5. Honor Home Languages: English language learners can feel pressured to master English fast, with class time spent correcting errors instead of using language in meaningful ways. Digital IS, a site published by the National Writing Project, shares plans for three projects that take time to honor students' home languages and cultures, engaging them in critical thinking, collaboration, and use of digital tools. Anne Herrington and Charlie Moran curate the project collection, \\\"English Language Learners, Digital Tools, and Authentic Audiences.\\\"\\n6. Rethink Lunch: Make lunch into a learning opportunity with a project that gets students thinking more critically about their mid-day meal. Center for Ecoliteracy offers materials to help you start, including informative including informative essays and downloadable planning guides. Get more ideas from this video about a middle-school nutrition project, \\\"A Healthy School Lunch.\\\"\\n7. Take a Learning Expedition: Expeditionary Learning schools take students on authentic learning expeditions, often in neighborhoods close to home. Check out the gallery for project ideas about everything from the tools people use in their work to memories of the Civil Rights Movement.\\n8. Find a Pal: If PBL is new to you, consider joining an existing project. You'll benefit from a veteran colleague's insights, and your students will get a chance to collaborate with classmates from other communities or even other countries. Get connected at ePals, a global learning community for educators from more than 200 countries.\\n9. Get Minds Inquiring: What's under foot? What are things made of? Science projects that emphasize inquiry help students make sense of their world and build a solid foundation for future understanding. The Inquiry Project supports teachers in third to fifth grades as they guide students in hands-on investigations about matter. Students develop the habits of scientists as they make observations, offer predictions, and gather evidence. Companion videos show how scientists use the same methods to explore the world. Connect inquiry activities to longer-term projects, such as creating a classroom museum that showcases students' investigations.\\n10. Learn through Service: When cases of the West Nile virus were reported in their area, Minnesota students sprang into action with a project that focused on preventing the disease through public education. Their project demonstrates what can happen when service-learning principles are built into PBL. Find more ideas for service-learning projects from the National Youth Leadership Council.\\n11. Locate Experts: When students are learning through authentic projects, they often need to connect with experts from the world outside the classroom. Find the knowledgeable experts you need for STEM projects through the National Lab Network. It's an online network where K-12 educators can locate experts from the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\\n12. Build Empathy: Projects that help students see the world from another person's perspective build empathy along with academic outcomes. The Edutopia video, \\\"Give Me Shelter\\\", shows what compassionate learning looks like in action. Click on the companion links for more suggestions about how you can do it, too.\\n13. Investigate Climate Science: Take students on an investigation of climate science by joining the newest collaborative project hosted by GLOBE, Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment. The Student Climate Research Campaign includes three components: introductory activities to build a foundation of understanding, intensive observing periods when students around the world gather and report data, and research investigations that students design and conduct. Climate project kicks off Sept. 12.\\n14. Problem-Solvers Unite: Math fairs take mathematics out of the classroom and into the community, where everyone gets a chance to try their hand at problem solving. Galileo Educational Network explains how to host a math fair. In a nutshell, students set up displays of their math problems but not the solutions. Then they entice their parents and invited guests to work on solutions. Make the event even more engaging by inviting mathematicians to respond to students' problems.\\n15. Harvest Pennies : Can small things really add up to big results? It seems so, based on results of the Penny Harvest. Since the project started in New York in 1991, young philanthropists nationwide have raised and donated more than $8 million to charitable causes, all through penny drives. The project website explains how to organize students in philanthropy roundtables to study community issues and decide which causes they want to support.\\n16. Gather Stories: Instead of teaching history from textbooks, put students in the role of historian and help them make sense of the past. Learn more about how to plan oral history projects in the Edutopia story, \\\"Living Legends.\\\" Teach students about the value of listening by having them gather stories for StoryCorps.\\n17. Angry Bird Physics: Here's a driving question to kickstart a science project: \\\"What are the laws of physics in Angry Birds world?\\\" Read how physics teachers like Frank Noschese and John Burk are using the web version of the popular mobile game in their classrooms.\\n18. Place-Based Projects: Make local heritage, landscapes, and culture the jumping-off point for compelling projects. That's the idea behind place-based education, which encourages students to look closely at their communities. Often, they wind up making significant contributions to their communities, as seen in the City of Stories project.\\n19. News They Can Use: Students don't have to wait until they're grown-ups to start publishing. Student newspapers, radio stations, and other journalism projects give them real-life experiences now. Award-winning journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki outlines the benefits this post on the New York Times Learning Network. Get more ideas about digital-age citizen journalism projects at MediaShift Idea Lab.\\n20. The Heroes They Know: To get acquainted with students at the start of the year and also introduce students to PBL processes, High Tech High teacher Diana Sanchez asked students to create a visual and textual representation of a hero in their own life. Their black-and-white exhibits were a source of pride to students, as Sanchez explains in her project reflection . Get more ideas from the project gallery at High Tech High, a network of 11 schools in San Diego County that emphasize PBL. To learn more, watch this Edutopia video interview with High Tech High founding principal Larry Rosenstock.\\nPlease tell us about the projects you are planning for this school year. Questions about PBL? Draw on the wisdom of your colleagues by starting discussions or asking for help in the PBL community.\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:6d6b12c8-51d9-4d93-b798-19f2bbb48a21>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/20-ideas-for-engaging-projects-suzie-boss?quicktabs_edutopia_blogs_sidebar_popular_list=0\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9446845650672913, \"token_count\": 1793, \"score\": 3.515625, \"int_score\": 4}\n"

"{\"text\": \"- November 15th, 2008\\n- Derek Robertson\\n- Comments: 7 Comments \u00bbTags: Consolarium, Endless Ocean, games based learning, Wii\\nEndless Ocean for the Nintendo Wii was one of those games that immediately caught my eye. A wonderful world in which the player can become immersed in a rich, vibrant and somewhat hypnotically therapeutic underwater world. I\u2019ve written about how I thought it might be used to drive learning before but my initial ideas have been put into place and extended beyond recognition by some really creative teachers.\\nLast week I went with Margaret Cassidy from Stirling Council to Cowie PS to see a teacher that was using Endless Ocean with her class:\\nMrs Bullivant and her class of P.6 children treated me to an afternoon of sheer joy. I walked in to a class that had been turned into an underwater world that was awash with a tide of enthusiastic and industrious learnning.\\n- Streamers of various shades of blue were hung from two lines that criss-crossed the class.From these lines also hung starfish, sharks and other underwater creatures that the children had made.\\n- The Wii was hooked up to the whiteboard and the gameplay was integral to the learning.\\n- The children were divided into \u2018dive teams\u2019 and their \u2018dive leader\u2019 had to manage certain aspects of how the children worked together.\\n- Children were engaged with a teacher led leson that investigated buoyancy.\\n- Children were searching the web to find out more about some of the creatures that they discovered in the game.\\n- A spreadsheet activity detailing the range of creatures that they had discovered was in place.\\n- A shipwreck (created by the janitor) was sitting in the class. This helped drive much of the creative writing work.\\n- The children created treasure maps and were using these to look at grid references.\\n- Mermaids were created in art and design and very lifelike they were too!\\n- Reference books were in great demand when I was in the class and the initial stimulus of the game appeared to drive a real interest for what could be found in the complementary resource that was the book.\\n- Children actively encouraged to measure exactly how long 7 metres is as a result of finding out that that was how long a Great White Shark was.\\nThis was just a wonderful visit and an example of what learning in class can be. Yes we need creative teachers to lead this but isn\u2019t that what we are meant to be. The work that was in evidence in this class was delightful to witness and further cemented my ideas of the possibilities of sandbox games such as Endless Ocean.\\nCategories Stirling Council\", \"id\": \"<urn:uuid:ed02b25b-582c-477f-af77-6a012b479875>\", \"dump\": \"CC-MAIN-2013-20\", \"url\": \"http://blogs.educationscotland.gov.uk/consolarium/2008/11/15/endless-ocean-and-endless-learning-in-stirling/\", \"file_path\": \"s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz\", \"language\": \"en\", \"language_score\": 0.9867492318153381, \"token_count\": 553, \"score\": 2.546875, \"int_score\": 3}\n"
