{"text": "Science Fair Project Encyclopedia\nThe chloride ion is formed when the element chlorine picks up one electron to form the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl\u2212. The salts of hydrochloric acid HCl contain chloride ions and are also called chlorides. An example is table salt, which is sodium chloride with the chemical formula NaCl. In water, it dissolves into Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions.\nThe word chloride can also refer to a chemical compound in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded in the molecule. This means that chlorides can be either inorganic or organic compounds. The simplest example of an inorganic covalently bonded chloride is hydrogen chloride, HCl. A simple example of an organic covalently bonded chloride is chloromethane (CH3Cl), often called methyl chloride.\nOther examples of inorganic covalently bonded chlorides which are used as reactants are:\n- phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, and thionyl chloride - all three are reactive chlorinating reagents which have been used in a laboratory.\n- Disulfur dichloride (SCl2) - used for vulcanization of rubber.\nChloride ions have important physiological roles. For instance, in the central nervous system the inhibitory action of glycine and some of the action of GABA relies on the entry of Cl\u2212 into specific neurons.\nThe contents of this article is licensed from www.wikipedia.org under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Power is entrusted to a cardinal called the Camerlengo, in this case Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who under normal circumstances would bury the Pope.\nThe last papal election took 48 hours, but such speed wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 13th century the papacy was vacant for a year-and-a-half and an election was forced by the people of Rome who locked up the cardinals until a pope was elected. In another case, the people not only locked up the cardinals, they tore off the roof of the building and put the cardinals on a diet of bread and water.\nNow, with Benedict\u2019s resignation the cardinals are essentially being given a \u2018month\u2019s notice\u2019 and can plan their trip to Rome and think about what they want in the new pope. In a sense, because of the pre-planning that can be brought to bear on this election, there is potentially a lot of time to consider who should be the next leader of the world\u2019s 1 billion catholics.\nThe cardinals will stay in a specially constructed 5 storey residence inside the Vatican walls, Santa Marta. and will be conveyed by coach to the Sistine Chapel for morning and afternoon sessions there. The process of election must begin no more than 20 days after the see is vacant. Only cardinals under the age of 80 can enter the conclave \u2013 the word means \u2018with a key\u2019 in Latin, referring to the fact that the Cardinals are locked into the election hall.\nThere are 119 eligible to vote, 67 of whom were appointed by Benedict and the rest by JPII. Cardinals who are excommunicated can actually attend but not those who have resigned. A cardinal who resigned and joined Napolean Bonaparte attempted to enter the conclave in 1800 but was refused.\nOn the morning of the conclave the cardinals con-celebrate Mass in St Peter\u2019s Basilica. In the afternoon they gather in the Pauline Chapel in the Apostolic Palace and solemnly process in full red and white regalia with red hats and enter the Sistine chapel, with the doors locked behind them. All telephones, cell phones, radios, televisions and internet connections are removed from use whether in the chapel or in the residence. They cannot leave except in the case of grave illness. Also permitted in the conclave are two medical doctors, a nurse for very ill cardinals, and religious priests who can hear confessions in various languages. These have to swear absolute and perpetual secrecy.\nThe cardinals swear an oath of secrecy not to discuss the elections outside the Chapel and everyone else is ordered out in the Latin words \u201cExtra omnes,\u201d \u201cEverybody out.\u201d The doors of the Sistine Chapel and the Residence of the Cardinals are closed.\nInside, a meditation is given concerning the grave duty of the cardinals and they are exhorted to \u201conly have God before your eyes.\u201d The rest of the time is spent for prayer and voting in silence, there are no campaign speeches. Negotiations and arguments have to take place outside.\nIn the Chapel, which dates from the 15th Century, and under the ceiling adorned with Michelangelo's Last Judgement, the cardinals can cast their vote. There will be four ballots daily until a clear majority is found for one candidate.\nIt is severely frowned upon to seek the office of Pope and canvassing for it is severely prohibited, especially prior to a Pope dying. It is an office bestowed upon a person rather than their contesting for it. However an outsider could be elected pope and in theory it could be a lay person willing to be ordained a priest and bishop but the weight of tradition suggests it will be one of the cardinals gathered in the Sistine chapel. The last non cardinal was Pope Urban in 1378.\nHowever, discussions prior to a ballot among cardinals do occur privately but public campaigning would be counter productive. Dinners are good vehicles for discussions. However, the best known cardinals tend to be the ones that work in the Vatican and meet other bishops, and cardinals when they come on business to Rome.\nThe ballot is secret and Pope John Paul II abolished two methods of election: by compromise or by common consent. Since 1179, a new Pope requires a two thirds majority. Now, after 33 ballots, a simple majority is enough. If there is no progress in choosing a candidate, a day of prayer is set aside. However, not since 1831 has an election lasted more than four days.\nThe ballot papers themselves are rectangular with \u201cI elect as supreme pontiff\u201d printed at the top and each cardinal prints or writes a name in a way that disguises his handwriting. One at a time they approach the altar with the folded ballot held up, he kneels and prays and then places the ballot in a silver and gilded bronze urn, much like a wok with a lid. Cardinals called \u2018scrutineers\u2019 count the ballots. After the ballots are read aloud they are placed on a thread and placed in another urn. They are then burnt.\nSince 1903, white smoke from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel has signalled the election of a pope; black smoke signals another vote.\nWhen a pope is finally elected, the cardinal dean asks him, \u201cDo you accept your canonical election as supreme pontiff?\u201d Rarely does anyone say no. St Philip Benize was offered it in 1271 and fled and hid until another candidate was chosen.\nSacristy of Tears\nAfter the \u2018yes\u2019, he is led into the \u2018Sacristy of Tears\u2019 or commonly called \u2018Room of Tears,\u2019 a small room off the Sistine Chapel. It is here that the enormity of what has just happened hits the new Pope, though the tears may be of sorrow or joy. Traditionally they were said to be tears of humility as a Pope was following in the footsteps of St Peter; others would contend the tears were because essentially the Pope becomes a \u2018prisoner\u2019 of the Vatican and would be bowed down by the weight of the office.\nThe new Pope picks one of three sizes of Papal garments \u2013 presumably small, medium or large \u2013 and return to the High Altar to receive the homage of the cardinals. Meanwhile, the ballots are burnt in a stove with a chemical which turns the smoke white, telling the world of the newly elected Pontiff.\nA Cardinal is then sent to the Loggia of the Benedictions on the fa\u00e7ade of St Peter\u2019s where he says: \u201cAnnuntio vobis gaudium magnum. I announce to you a great joy! Habemus Papam. We have a Pope!\u201d He then announces the name of the cardinal and the name he has chosen to use as Pope.\nThe new Pope steps onto the balcony and therefore onto the stage of world and church history. He may grant his first blessing to the world.\nSome days later, the new Pope will go down into the foundations of St Peter\u2019s to the tomb of Peter, the first Pope and first bishop of Rome, and pray. Then with all the cardinals, he will process into St Peter\u2019s Square to begin his first public Mass and receive the main symbols of his office: the fisherman\u2019s ring and the pallium.", "id": "<urn:uuid:fe661bb9-3884-4391-9c13-161ffd3496bc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.irishcentral.com/news/What-to-expect-at-Conclave-in-unusual-case-of-Pope-Benedict-stepping-down-from-Vatican-role-191795261.html?mob-ua=mobile", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9714189171791077, "token_count": 1662, "score": 2.78125, "int_score": 3}
{"text": "What They Are and How to Learn More about the Appellate Courts and the Justices Who Serve on Them\nEvery four years, more than a third of California\u2019s 99 court of appeal justices face California voters for retention. In addition, several of the seven justices on the California Supreme Court face retention elections every four years. These are not contested elections; no one may run against the justices. Instead, the voters simply decide whether the justice shall continue to serve. If a majority of voters cast \"yes\" votes for a particular justice, that justice remains for another term. The Code of Judicial Ethics requires all judges \"to be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism . . . .\" The retention election system, adopted by California voters as part of the State Constitution, is designed specifically to foster judges\u2019 independence from improper external pressures.\nBecause supreme court justices hold statewide offices, voters everywhere in California decide whether to retain them. In contrast, because court of appeal justices serve in districts, voters in each district alone decide whether to retain them. California\u2019s 99 court of appeal justices are divided among six districts, centered in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Fresno, and San Jose.\nSupreme and appellate court justices generally do not actively campaign for retention. The only promise they can make voters is to decide appeals impartially and according to the law, without fear or favor toward any individual or group. However, they do seek to provide helpful information to voters. The justices have worked closely and actively with the Secretary of State\u2019s Office to help the public learn more about the appellate courts, who the appellate justices are, and what they do.\nAs a consequence, voters everywhere in California can easily get biographical information on every justice who appears on the ballot. As to supreme court justices, the information is contained in the statewide ballot pamphlet sent to all voters by the Secretary of State. As to court of appeal justices, the official statewide voter pamphlet does not contain biographical sketches, but does refer voters to an Internet website and a toll-free telephone hotline so they may obtain justices\u2019 biographies, either on-line or through receipt of the Judicial Information Bookleton request. The Secretary of State\u2019s Internet website and Judicial Information Booklet also include brief descriptions of the appellate courts and how they differ from trial courts.\nTo gain access to these materials, voters may go to the Secretary of State\u2019s Internet website at http://www.ss.ca.gov/ or call the telephone hotline at 1(800) 345-VOTE.\nWhile supreme and appellate court justices perform their roles quietly and without fanfare, the public can find much of their work published in law books titled \"California Reports,\" \"California Appellate Reports\" and \"California Reporter.\" Each of California\u2019s 58 counties has a public law library containing these books, as do law schools and most law offices. Recently issued opinions are available on the same day they are filed at 'Opinions' which is maintained by the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), State of California.\nAdding to the data supplied by the Secretary of State, the Judicial Branch\u2019s website that you are currently reading from also contains biographical information about all the appellate court justices, as well as informative articles entitled \"How Appellate and Supreme Court Justices are Selected\" and \"What Appellate Justices Do.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:19b4e4f2-853a-4b46-baf8-25a9494b759b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/4192.htm", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9415530562400818, "token_count": 706, "score": 2.609375, "int_score": 3}

Select this link to remove all filters.\nPerl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers. Larry Wall continues to oversee development of the core language, and its upcoming version, Perl 6. Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, shell scripting (sh), AWK, and sed. The language provides powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data length limits of many contemporary Unix tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its parsing abilities.

{"text": "Why Man U?\nAskMen / Getty Images\n\"Gathering together at Old Trafford must have given these people something of the sense of community that they had previously known in their villages.\"\nVisiting Manchester the other day, I was driving down a nondescript road past dreary shops and offices when I saw the top of a sports stadium poking into the gray sky. It was Old Trafford. Team buses carrying soccer players from more glamorous cities such as Barcelona have been known to echo with cries of disgust as they pull in here.\nThe home of Manchester United is rainy and underwhelming. The estimated 333 million humans who consider themselves United fans don\u2019t all know that Manchester is a city in England, but many of those who do would probably be surprised to find just how mid-ranking a city it is. Yet when United\u2019s American ruling family, the Glazers, sold club shares in August, United was valued at $2.3 billion. That made it the world\u2019s most valuable sports franchise, ahead of Real Madrid and baseball\u2019s New York Yankees, according to Forbes. In short, United is bigger than Manchester. So why on earth did this global behemoth arise precisely here? And how, in the last 134 years, has United shaped soccer, in England and now the world?\nWhen a soccer club was created just by the newish railway line in 1878, the Manchester location actually helped. The city was then growing like no other on earth. In 1800 it had been a tranquil little place of 84,000 inhabitants, so insignificant that as late as 1832 it didn\u2019t have a member of parliament. The Industrial Revolution changed everything. Workers poured in from English villages, from Ireland, from feeble economies everywhere (my own great-grandparents arrived on the boat from Lithuania). By 1900, Manchester was Europe\u2019s sixth-biggest city, with 1.25 million inhabitants.\nThe club by the railway line was initially called Newton Heath, because the players worked at the Newton Heath carriage works of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company. They played in work clogs against other work teams. Jim White\u2019s Manchester United: The Biography nicely describes the L&YR workers as \u201csucked in from all over the country to service the growing need for locomotives and carriages.\u201d Life in Manchester then was neither fun nor healthy, White writes. In some neighborhoods, average male life expectancy was just 17. This was still the same brutal city where a few decades before, Karl Marx\u2019s pal Friedrich Engels had run his father\u2019s factory. The conditions of the industrial city were so awful it inspired communism. (My own great-grandparents lost two of their children to scarlet fever in Manchester before moving on to much healthier southern Africa.)\nInevitably, most of these desperate early Mancunians were rootless migrants. Unmoored in their new home, many embraced the local soccer clubs. Gathering together at Old Trafford must have given these people something of the sense of community that they had previously known in their villages. That\u2019s how the world\u2019s first great industrial city engendered the world\u2019s greatest soccer brand.
