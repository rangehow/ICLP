{"text": "With the development of science and technology, computer has become more and more popular in our daily life, which is intended to be a part of our life. But at the same time it also brings the safety problem, because increasing number of bad people would like to break into computer systems to steal the secret information. It seems that computer safety has been a serious problem by now. Maybe you could learn something about the safety terms in Microsoft so that you could adopt the different methods according to different cases.\nWhat is malware? In fact malware, short for \u201cmalicious software\u201d, is any kind of software which is installed without your complete permission and is not in need at all.The famous malware areviruses, worms, and Trojan horses, which are almost known to us all. Even though you are not familiar with them, you must have heard of it at ordinary times. If you want to protect your computer from the malware, you could make sure that the automatic updating is turned on all the time to get the latest updates.\n2 antispyware software\nAntispyware software helps protect your computer, and prevent the pop-ups, slow performance, and security threats caused by spyware and other adverse software. Every computer user must keep antispyware software up to date in order to keep in touch with the latest spyware. Aimed at protecting our computer, we could use Microsoft Security Essentials, free download software, to be against spyware and other malicious software.\nA firewall is used to help screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that try to attack your computer through the Internet.In fact, if you are the one who use the computer at home, the most efficient and important step is to enable firewall when you start your computer. A virus will slip through and infect you; the only effective way by protecting yourself is using a firewall. A firewall monitors your Internet connections and allows you to specify which programs are allowed to connect and which are not.\n4 antivirus software\nAntivirus software is a kind of computer program which can be used to test, defend, and take actions to remove or delete malicious software program. As we all know, computer virus is some programs, which can specially disturb computer operation. So we should update antivirus software in regular time to prevent against the latest virus.\n5 Windows password\nBesides the above mentioned software, you could have an alternative at the same time, namely Windows password. With a password like this, you can prevent your privacy from being let out or being viewed. Of course you should set up a Windows password reset disk to set the password reset in case that you forget it.\nAs a computer user, you should have a general knowledge of these safety terms so that you can protect your computer better. And with these terms, your computer can be protected better than that without them. In a word, please have a brief understanding of them in the first place, and then you could know how important they are.", "id": "<urn:uuid:3d310cea-07c0-49a6-a372-5da020bfac96>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.resetwindowspassword.com/tag/antivirus", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9521350860595703, "token_count": 607, "score": 3.1875, "int_score": 3}
{"text": "Just as there are many variants and forms of electronic malware and Internet-based threats around the globe, so there are many forms of protection against these threats. Signature-based detection is one of the multifarious forms of defense that have been developed in order to keep us safe from malicious content.\nAlthough signature-based detection can be argued to have been overshadowed by more sophisticated methods of protection in some environments, it remains as a core \u2018technique\u2019 featuring in the anti-virus controls of packages and suites that work to protect a user\u2019s system today.\nHow does signature-based detection work?\nSignature-based detection works by scanning the contents of computer files and cross-referencing their contents with the \u201ccode signatures\u201d belonging to known viruses. A library of known code signatures is updated and refreshed constantly by the anti-virus software vendor.\nIf a viral signature is detected, the software acts to protect the user\u2019s system from damage. Suspected files are typically quarantined and/or encrypted in order to render them inoperable and useless.\nClearly there will always be new and emerging viruses with their own unique code signatures. So once again, the anti-virus software vendor works constantly to assess and assimilate new signature-based detection data as it becomes available, often in real time so that updates can be pushed out to users immediately and zero-day vulnerabilities can be avoided.\nNext-generation signature-based detection\nNew variants of computer virus are of course developed every day and security companies now work to also protect users from malware that attempts to disguise itself from traditional signature-based detection. Virus authors have tried to avoid their malicious code being detected by writing \u201coligomorphic\u201c, \u201cpolymorphic\u201d and more recently \u201cmetamorphic\u201d viruses with signatures that are either disguised or changed from those that might be held in a signature directory.\nDespite these developments, the Internet at large does of course still function on a daily basis. Populated as it is by users who not only have up to date security software installed, but also by those who have educated themselves as to the type of risks discussed here.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1dc7b057-7b64-4e02-98fa-2e3e2cfcf30c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.avg.com/business/signature-based-detection/", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9653883576393127, "token_count": 449, "score": 3.015625, "int_score": 3}

Hence the white tea name.\n- White tea has a subtle and slightly sweet flavor that sharpens the senses without overwhelming the tongue, whereas green tea has a \u201cgrassy\u201d taste.\n- There is 25% to 30% less caffeine in white tea than in green tea, though it depends on the variety.\n- White tea health benefits are the highest among the tea family\u00b9.\n- It is more expensive than green or black tea because white tea is scarcer.

{"text": "What Is Mead?\nMead, also known as honey wine, is regarded as the oldest of fermented beverage and has stood the test of time. From the dawn of pre-history to today mead has long been regarded as a delicacy, often referred to as the \"nectar of the gods\". The earliest archaeological evidence for the production of mead dates to around 7000 BC where pottery vessels containing a mixture of mead, rice and other fruits along with organic compounds of fermentation were found in Northern China.\nCrafted Artisan Meadery uses the finest raw, unfiltered, unpastuerized honey as well as fruits, spices, herbs, and other natural ingredients to create an experience that is solely \"mead\". Some of our meads are aged on oak and others not...oak does wonders to an already complex mead. Our use of honey might make you think that mead is only sweet. While mead can be made as sweet as a dessert wine it can also be made dry...and anywhere in between. Yes, you'll find a little of \"traditional wine\" and even a little of \"craft beer\" elements but mead is an experience all it's own. Where other beverages work within the confines of industry standards and style categories mead can be broken down into a few broad categories that allow us to be as creative and unique as we want...there are no rules.\nTraditional Traditional mead is purely Honey, Water, and Yeast. Traditionals allow the chosen honey to be showcased and the drinker to explore the characteristics of that honey. Tupelo, Clover, Orange Blossom, the list is long...there is a wide array of varietal honey available each with it's own unique flavor and aroma characteristics.\nMelomel Melomels are mead crafted using fruit, honey, water and yeast. Fresh and local: any fruit can be used but we tend to stick to fruits that we can source locally to ensure the freshest and best product possible. We build relationships with our vendors and often times find ourselves hauling a trailer load of cider or blueberries back from their family operations. Ask us, we'd love to share with you how to find these great local farms.\nMetheglin Metheglins are mead crafted using spices and/or herbs, honey, water and yeast. Cinnamon, vanilla and hibiscus are just a few examples of the countless ingredients we can use. The name \"metheglin\" finds it origins in the welsh translation \"medicine\" where these herbal elixirs were seen as have healing powers. We can't vouch for medicinal qualities but can say that a good metheglin is tough to beat.\nPyment Pyments are mead crafted using wine grapes, honey, water, and yeast. While being a type of melomel pyments are worth noting for their combination of elements of both wine and mead. While using red or white grapes honey is used to create something that is truly unique.\nCyser Cysers are mead crafted using apple cider, honey, and yeast. Being in Northeast Ohio we are in a prime location for some of the best tasting and freshest apple cider around. With our local sources we are usually able to begin a cyser fermentation within a day or two of the cider being pressed.

{"text": "The Warrior Diet exercise and nutrition program, created by Ori Hofmekler, hinges on a somewhat controversial diet based on a daily cycle of \u201cundereating\u201d during the day and \u201covereating\u201d at night.\nThe rationale is that the historic \u201cwarrior\u201d, in order to succeed in the environment of the time, had a primal need to cycle between undereating during the day (when physical activity and danger were always present), and overeating at night (when able to rest and eat a good daily meal).\nModern humans in a changed environment can therefore restore health and fitness, by returning to that cycle with the Warrior Diet.\nWarrior Diet grounding\nThe nervous system is the primary focus here, specifically that part called the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Body organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines (viscera), and muscles within these organs and other areas like blood vessels, skin, and eyes, as well as the glands of the body, are regulated by the ANS. We are mostly unaware of its workings; for example, when blood vessels change size or when our heart beats faster, these functions are involuntary and reflexive in nature.\nThe ANS has 3 parts -\n- The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which kicks in when emergencies occur, causing stress and requiring us to \u201cfight\u201d or take \u201cflight\u201d (flee)\n- The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) which operates in normal or nonemergency times, allowing us to \u201crest\u201d and \u201cdigest\u201d\n- The enteric nervous system (ENS), present in all vertebrates, which regulates the normal digestive activity of the digestive system and prepares it for whatever is coming, whether a meal or a frantic energy-sapping physical activity\nThe undereating phase of the Warrior Diet is supposed to prepare and alert the SNS to potential stress, resulting in the generation of energy and ultimately the burning of fat. While undereating, the body is forced to use fat storage as a source of fuel for maximum metabolic efficiency \u2013 thus promoting weight-loss.\nThe overeating phase of the Warrior Diet recognizes the role of the PSNS in regulating digestion, elimination and other metabolic activities that slow you down. Eating during the day stops this process and blocks the body\u2019s ability to remove toxins and waste from the body. Since detoxification is imperative for health and to delay aging, eating occurs mainly at night.\nWarrior Diet program\nThe program involves a Fat Loss Program and exercise and nutrition regimes.\nFat Loss Program\nThe Fat Loss program is specifically designed to\n- Force the body to detoxify\n- Improve utilization of fat as fuel\n- Improve utilization of carb as fuel\nThis process helps to boost overall metabolic rate, thereby enhancing the body\u2019s capacity to maximize fat loss.\nExercise and Nutrition Programs\nExercise and nutrition programs provide short, intense strength and aerobic exercises, along with pre-workout and post-workout meals. This approach intends to reduce fat while maintaining or improving muscle tone.\nThe emphasis of the Warrior Diet program is on having large evening meals on the one hand, and shedding the \u201ccalorie counting\u201d common to most diets on the other.\nThe Warrior Diet by Ori Hofmekler.", "id": "<urn:uuid:e39ee72b-f208-43f0-9439-59a5d06c3a3a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.everydiet.org/diet/warrior-diet", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9463229179382324, "token_count": 688, "score": 2.984375, "int_score": 3}
{"text": "Other Proposed Treatments\nIt is one of the cardinal principles of natural medicine that treatment should aim not only to treat illness but also to enhance wellness. According to this ideal, a proper course of treatment should improve your sense of general well-being, enhance your immunity to illness, raise your physical stamina, and increase mental alertness, as well as resolve the specific condition you took it for.\nUnfortunately, while there can be little doubt that this is a laudable goal, it is easier to laud it than to achieve it. Conventional medicine tends to focus on treating diseases rather than increasing wellness, not as a matter of philosophical principle, but because it is easier to accomplish.\nProbably the strongest force affecting wellness is genetics. Beyond that, common sense steps endorsed by all physicians include increasing exercise, reducing stress, improving diet, getting enough sleep, and living a life of moderation without bad habits, such as smoking or overeating.\nBeyond this, however, it is difficult to make strong affirmations, and the optimum forms of diet and exercise and other aspects of lifestyle remain unclear. In fact, they may always remain unclear, as it is impossible to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on most lifestyle habits. (For information on why such studies are irreplaceable see \"Why Does This Database Depend on Double-blind Studies?\" )\nPrincipal Proposed Natural Treatments\nIn order to function at our best, we need good nutrition. However, the modern diet often fails to provide people with sufficient amounts of all the necessary nutrients. For this reason, use of a multivitamin/multimineral supplement might be expected to enhance overall health and well-being, and preliminary double-blind trials generally support this view.\nFor more information, see the article on General Nutritional Support .\nThe herb Panax ginseng has an ancient reputation as a healthful \u201ctonic.\u201d According to a more modern concept developed in the former USSR, ginseng functions as an \u201cadaptogen.\u201d\nThis term is defined as follows: An adaptogen helps the body adapt to stresses of various kinds, whether heat, cold, exertion, trauma, sleep deprivation, toxic exposure, radiation, infection, or psychologic stress. In addition, an adaptogen causes no side effects, is effective in treating a wide variety of illnesses, and helps return an organism toward balance no matter what may have gone wrong.\nFrom a modern scientific perspective, it is not truly clear that such things as adaptogens actually exist. However, there is some evidence that ginseng may satisfy some of the definition\u2019s requirements.\nIn addition, ginseng has also shown some potential for enhancing immunity , mental function , and sports performance , all effects consistent with the adaptogen concept. For more information on these possibilities, as well as dosage and safety issues, see the full Ginseng article .\nOther Proposed Natural Treatments\nNumerous other alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to improve overall wellness, including acupuncture , Ayurveda , chiropractic , detoxification , homeopathy , massage , naturopathy , osteopathic manipulation , Reiki , Tai Chi , Therapeutic Touch , traditional Chinese herbal medicine , and yoga . However, there is as yet little meaningful evidence to support these claims.\nFor a discussion of homeopathic approaches to general wellness, see the Homeopathy database .\n- Reviewer: EBSCO CAM Review Board\n- Review Date: 07/2012 -\n- Update Date: 07/25/2012 -", "id": "<urn:uuid:39bb84af-9a63-43d7-b933-3bee4727c361>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://memorialhospitaljax.com/your-health/?/38569/general-well-being", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9366875886917114, "token_count": 726, "score": 2.90625, "int_score": 3}
