POES satellites orbit the earth 14 times each day at an altitude of approximately 520 miles (870 km). As each orbit is made the satellite can view a 1,600 mile (2,700 km) wide area of the earth. Due to the rotation of the earth the satellite is able to view every spot on earth twice each day.

{"text": "The press release doesn\u2019t contain any pictures, and really doesn\u2019t do this new web tool justice, so I\u2019ve added some screencaps. In a nutshell, the new iSWA site lets you arrange graphical packages of solar images and plots oncsreen for simultaneous evaluation. Stuff that had been scattered over several solar related websites is now in one interface. Pretty cool. \u2013 Anthony\nWhen NASA\u2019s satellite operators need accurate, real-time space-weather information, they turn to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. The CCMC\u2019s newest and most advanced space-weather science tool is the Integrated Space Weather Analysis (iSWA) system.\nThe iSWA is a robust, integrated system provides information about space weather conditions past, present, and future and, unlike many other programs currently in use, has an interface that the user can customize to suit a unique set of data requirements.\n\u201cThe iSWA space-weather data analysis system offers a unique level of customization and flexibility to maintain, modify, and add new tools and data products as they become available,\u201d says Marlo Maddox, iSWA system chief developer at NASA Goddard.\niSWA draws together information about conditions from the sun to the boundary of the sun\u2019s influence, known as the heliosphere. The iSWA systems digests information from spacecraft including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), NASA\u2019s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the joint European Space Agency and NASA mission Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and NASA\u2019s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE).\nCitizen scientists and science enthusiasts can also use the data, models, and tools of the iSWA system. Similar to the way in which armchair astronomers have used SOHO data to discover comets, enthusiasts will find the iSWA system a wonderful resource for increasing their familiarity with the concept of space weather.\n\u201cWe are continuously evolving the iSWA system, and we hope that it will benefit not only NASA satellite operators, but also that it may also help space-weather forecasting at other agencies such as the Air Force Weather Agency and NOAA,\u201d says Michael Hesse, chief of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA Goddard.\nSpace-weather information tends to be scattered over various Web sites. NASA Goddard space physicist Antti Pulkkinen says the iSWA system represents \u201cthe most comprehensive single interface for general space-weather-related information,\u201d providing data on past and current space-weather events. The system allows the user to configure or design custom displays of the information.\nThe system compiles data about conditions on the sun, in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere \u2014 the protective magnetic field that envelops our planet \u2014 and down to Earth\u2019s surface. It provides a user interface to provide NASA\u2019s satellite operators and with a real-time view of space weather. In addition to NASA, the iSWA system is used by the Air Force Weather agency.\nAccess to space-weather information that combines data from state-of-the-art space-weather models with concurrent observations of the space environment provides a powerful tool for users to obtain a personalized \u201cquick look\u201d at space-weather information, detailed insight into space-weather conditions, as well as tools for historical analysis of the space-weather\u2019s impact.\nDevelopment of the iSWA system has been a joint activity between the Office of the Chief Engineer at NASA Headquarters and the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate and the Science and Exploration Directorate at NASA Goddard. The iSWA system is located at NASA Goddard.\nThe Community Coordinated Modeling Center is funded by the Heliophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters, and the National Science Foundation.\nLayout selector tool:", "id": "<urn:uuid:ee290d5b-d6ca-45b4-9106-2c14f262df50>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/02/24/new-all-in-one-space-weather-tool-from-nasa/", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8825551271438599, "token_count": 837, "score": 2.640625, "int_score": 3}
{"text": "By Jason Kohn, Contributing Columnist\nLike many of us, scientific researchers tend to be creatures of habit. This includes research teams working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. government agency charged with measuring the behavior of oceans, atmosphere, and weather.\nMany of these climate scientists work with massive amounts of data \u2013 for example, the National Weather Service collecting up-to-the-minute temperature, humidity, and barometric readings from thousands of sites across the United States to help forecast weather. Research teams then rely on some the largest, most powerful high-performance computing (HPC) systems in the world to run models, forecasts, and other research computations.\nGiven the reliance on HPC resources, NOAA climate researchers have traditionally worked onsite at major supercomputing facilities, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where access to supercomputers are just steps away. As researchers crate ever more sophisticated models of ocean and atmospheric behavior, however, the HPC requirements have become truly staggering.\nNow, NOAA is using a super-high-speed network called \u201cn-wave\u201d to connect research sites across the United States with the computing resources they need. The network has been operating for several years, and today transports enough data to fill a 10-Gbps network to full capacity, all day, every day. NOAA is now upgrading this network to allow even more data traffic, with the goal of ultimately supporting 100-Gbps data rates.\n\u201cOur scientists were really used to having a computer in their basement,\u201d says Jerry Janssen, manager, n-wave Network, NOAA, in a video about the project. \u201cWhen that computer moved a couple thousand miles away, we had to give them a lot of assurances that, one, the data would actually move at the speed they needed it to move, but also that they could rely on it to be there. The amount of data that will be generated under this model will exceed 80-100 Terabits per day.\u201d\nThe n-wave project means much more than just a massive new data pipe. It represents a fundamental shift in the way that scientists can conduct their research, allowing them to perform hugely demanding supercomputer runs of their data from dozens of remote locations. As a result, it gives NOAA climate scientists much more flexibility in where and how they work.\n\u201cFor the first time, NOAA scientists and engineers in completely separate parts of the country, all the way to places like Alaska and Hawaii and Puerto Rico, will have the bandwidth they need, without restriction,\u201d says Janssen. \u201cNOAA will now be able to do things it never thought it could do before.\u201d\nIn addition to providing fast, stable access to HPC resources, n-wave is also allowing NOAA climate scientists to share resources much more easily with scientists in the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies. Ideally, this level of collaboration and access to supercomputing resources will help climate scientists continue to develop more effective climate models, improve weather forecasts, and allow us to better understand our climate.\nPowering Vital Climate Research\nThe high-speed nationwide HPC connectivity capability provided by n-wave is now enabling a broad range of NOAA basic science and research activities. Examples include:\n- Basic data dissemination, allowing research teams to collect up-to-the-minute data on ocean, atmosphere, and weather from across the country, and make that data available to other research teams and agencies nationwide.\n- Ensemble forecasting, where researchers run multiple HPC simulations using different initial conditions and modeling techniques, in order to refine their atmospheric forecasts and minimize errors.\n- Severe weather modeling, where scientists draw on HPC simulations, real-time atmospheric data, and archived storm data to better understand and predict the behavior of storms.\n- Advancing understanding of the environment to be able to better predict short-term and long-term environmental changes, mitigate threats, and provide the most accurate data to inform policy decisions.\nAll of this work is important, and will help advance our understanding of Earth\u2019s climate. And it is all a testament to the amazing networking technologies and infrastructure that scientists now have at their disposal, which puts the most powerful supercomputing resources in the world at their fingertips \u2013 even when they are thousands of miles away.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c23e3842-a002-4f6b-9554-bafecec0beed>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.cisco.com/cle/noaa-how-networks-are-used-in-climate-research/", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9429180026054382, "token_count": 899, "score": 3.3125, "int_score": 3}
{"text": "NOAA scientists agree the risks are high, but say Hansen overstates what science can really say for sure\nJim Hansen at the University of Colorado\u2019s World Affairs Conference (Photo: Tom Yulsman)\nSpeaking to a packed auditorium at the University of Colorado\u2019s World Affairs Conference on Thursday, NASA climatologist James Hansen found a friendly audience for his argument that we face a planetary emergency thanks to global warming.\nDespite the fact that the temperature rise has so far been relatively modest, \u201cwe do have a crisis,\u201d he said.\nWith his characteristic under-stated manner, Hansen made a compelling case. But after speaking with two NOAA scientists today, I think Hansen put himself in a familiar position: out on a scientific limb. And after sifting through my many pages of notes from two days of immersion in climate issues, I\u2019m as convinced as ever that journalists must be exceedingly careful not to overstate what we know for sure and what is still up for scientific debate.\nCrawling out on the limb, Hansen argued that global warming has already caused the levels of water in Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 the two giant reservoirs on the Colorado River than insure water supplies for tens of millions of Westerners \u2014 to fall to 50 percent of capacity. The reservoirs \u201cprobably will not be full again unless we decrease CO2 in the atmosphere,\u201d he asserted.\nHansen is arguing that simply reducing our emissions and stabilizing CO2 at about 450 parts per million, as many scientists argue is necessary, is not nearly good enough. We must reduce the concentration from today\u2019s 387 ppm to below 35o ppm.\n\u201cWe have already passed into the dangerous zone,\u201d Hansen said. If we don\u2019t reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, \u201cwe would be sending the planet toward an ice free state. We would have a chaotic journey to get there, but we would be creating a very different planet, and chaos for our children.\u201d Hansen\u2019s argument (see a paper on the subject here) is based on paleoclimate data which show that the last time atmospheric CO2 concentrations were this high, the Earth was ice free, and sea level was far higher than it is today.\n\u201cI agree with the sense of urgency,\u201d said Peter Tans, a carbon cycle expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration here in Boulder, in a meeting with our Ted Scripps Fellows in Environmental Journalism. \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree with a lot of the specifics. I don\u2019t agree with Jim Hansen\u2019s naming of 350 ppm as a tipping point. Actually we may have already gone too far, except we just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nA key factor, Tans said, is timing. \u201cIf it takes a million years for the ice caps to disappear, no problem. The issue is how fast? Nobody can give that answer.\u201d\nMartin Hoerling, a NOAA meteorologist who is working on ways to better determine the links between climate change and regional impacts, such as drought in the West, pointed out that the paleoclimate data Hansen bases his assertions on are coarse. They do not record year-to-year events, just big changes that took place over very long time periods. So that data give no indication just how long it takes to de-glaciate Antarctica and Greenland.\nHoerling also took issue with Hansen\u2019s assertions about lakes Powell and Mead. While it is true that \u201cthe West has had the most radical change in temperature in the U.S.,\u201d there is no evidence yet that this is a cause of increasing drought, he said.\nFlows in the Colorado River have been averaging about 12 million acre feet each year, yet we are consuming 14 million acre feet. \u201cWhere are we getting the extra from? Well, we\u2019re tapping into our 401K plan,\u201d he said. That would be the two giant reservoirs, and that\u2019s why their water levels have been declining.\n\u201cWhy is there less flow in the river?\u201d Hoerling said. \u201cLow precipitation \u2014 not every year, but in many recent years, the snow pack has been lower.\u201d And here\u2019s his almost counter-intuitive point: science shows that the reduced precipitation \u201cis due to natural climate variability . . . We see little indication that the warming trend is affecting the precipitation.\u201d\nIn my conversation with Tans and Hoerling today, I saw a tension between what they believe and what they think they can demonstrate scientifically.\n\u201cI like to frame the issue differently,\u201d Tans said. \u201cSure, we canot predict what the climate is going to look like in a couple of dcades. There are feedbacks in the system we don\u2019t understand. In fact, we don\u2019t even know all the feedbacks . . . To pick all this apart is extremely difficult \u2014 until things really happen. So I\u2019m pessimistic.\u201d\nThere is, Tans said, \u201ca finite risk of catastrophic climate change. Maybe it is 1 in 6, or maybe 1 in 20 or 1 in 3. Yet if we had a risk like that of being hit by an asteroid, we\u2019d know what to do. But the problem here is that we are the asteroid.\u201d\nTans argues that whether or not we can pin down the degree of risk we are now facing, one thing is obvious: \u201cWe have a society based on ever increasing consumption and economic expectations. Three percent growth forever is considered ideal. But of course it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d\nHoerling says we are living like the Easter Islanders, who were faced with collapse from over consumption of resources but didn\u2019t see it coming. Like them, he says, we are living in denial.\n\u201cI think we are in that type of risk,\u201d Tans said. \u201cBut is that moving people? It moves me.

{"text": "In fact, the United States apparently just emerged from the hottest spring on record.\nThe period between June 2011 and May of this year was the warmest on record since NOAA record keeping began in 1985. Aside from Washington, every state experienced higher-than-average temperatures during that period, which also featured the second-warmest summer and fourth-warmest winter in almost 28 years.\nThe nation's average temperature during those 12 months hovered at 56 degrees Fahrenheit, reportedly 3.2 degrees above the long-term average, surpassing the previous record, which was just set in April, in an analysis of temperatures between May 2011 and April 2012. The warmer-than-average conditions persisted through the winter and spring, resulting in a limited snowfall that the Rutgers Global Snow Lab reports was the third-smallest on record for the contiguous U.S.\nThe rising temperatures may have altered precipitation patterns as well, according to NOAA. While the country as a whole actually experienced a drier spring than usual, the West Coast, Northern Plains and Upper Midwest regions were simultaneously wetter than average.\nOn a more concerning note, the prevalence of natural disasters, such as the disastrous tornado in Joplin, Mo., and the massive, hurricane-caused flooding in Vermont, that plagued the country over the past year were also far form usual. The U.S. Climate Extreme Index, which tracks extremes in temperatures, precipitation, drought and tropical cyclones, reached 44 percent this past spring. That's twice the average value.\nThe NOAA report is not the only recent analysis to note the prevalence, and consequences, of rising temperatures. On Thursday, NASA reported that scientists have discovered unprecedented blooms of plant life beneath the waters of the Arctic Ocean. While that certainly does not seem like cause for concern, NASA noted it was likely caused by a thinning of the Arctic Ocean's three-foot thick layer of ice, allowing the sun to penetrate that ice to foster plant life under the sea.\nA continuous rise in summer temperatures is expected to triple the number of heat-related deaths in the U.S. by the end of the century, the Natural Resources Defense Council reported last month.

{"text": "How hot is it where you are? Tell your stories at CNN's iReport.\n(CNN) -- For many Americans, this summer has been miserably hot.\nHeat advisories and warnings have been issued from coast to coast, with high temperatures often reaching into the triple digits, and July went into the record books as the hottest month ever for the continental United States.\nBut in certain parts of the world, this is the norm -- or maybe even on the cool side.\nTry Kuwait City, for instance. In July, its average high temperature is 116 degrees Fahrenheit.\nOr Timbuktu in Mali, where the highs average 108 in May and was once recorded at 130. 130! That ranks fifth on the all-time list.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded on the planet was in 1922, when a thermometer in El Azizia, Libya, hit 136. Some dispute that mark, saying it was improperly measured. If that's true, the record would be the 134, reached nine years earlier in Death Valley, California.\nBut the world's hottest place might not be any of these, according to a team of scientists from the University of Montana. It says the highest temperatures on Earth are found in areas that don't even have weather stations.\n\"The Earth's hot deserts -- such as the Sahara, the Gobi, the Sonoran and the Lut -- are climatically harsh and so remote that access for routine measurements and maintenance of a weather station is impractical,\" said David Mildrexler, lead author of a recent study that used NASA satellites to detect the Earth's hottest surface temperatures.\nThe satellites detect the infrared energy emitted by land. And over a seven-year period, from 2003 to 2009, they found Iran's Lut Desert to be the hottest place on Earth.\nThe Lut Desert had the highest recorded surface temperature in five of the seven years, topping out at 159 degrees in 2005. Other notable annual highs came from Queensland, Australia (156 degrees in 2003) and China's Turpan Basin (152 degrees in 2008).\nIt's important to stress that surface temperatures are naturally higher than the air temperatures measured by weather stations. Air temperatures have to be measured by thermometers placed off the ground and shielded from sunlight, according to global meteorological standards.\nBut the study shows that today's modern records might not necessarily be the most accurate.\n\"Most of the places that call themselves the hottest on Earth are not even serious contenders,\" co-author Steve Running said.\nThe world's highest recorded air temperatures 1.

{"text": "If farmers are to increase food production and food security, they need better access to agricultural support systems, such as credit, technology, extension services and agricultural education, as well as to the rural organizations that often channel other services. Both men and women smallholders and poor farmers have frequently been cut off from these essential agricultural support systems, which seldom take into account the different responsibilities and needs of men and women farmers. In spite of their enormous potential and their crucial roles in agricultural production, women in particular have insufficient access to production inputs and support services.\nThis trend underlines the need to implement measures aimed at enhancing the access of small farmers, especially women, to production inputs - particularly since the working environment of development organizations has\nchanged as a result of market liberalization and a reduced role for the state worldwide. National agricultural extension systems are no exception to this rule, and must respond by making internal and external adjustments. Great attention is required so that the adjustments do not become detrimental to women and men small farmers. For example, FAO's field experiences over the last decade have pointed to the need for extension programmes that are more strategically planned, needs-based, participatory and problem solving.\nWomen's access to and use of agricultural support systems is also severely limited by the heavy burden on time and energy that results from their triple responsibilities - productive activities (such as work in the fields), reproductive activities (such as child rearing, cooking and household chores) and community management.\nIn order to improve production, farmers need access to financial capital. Buying seeds, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs often requires short-term loans, which are repaid when the crops are harvested. Installing major improvements, such as irrigation pumps, or acquiring new technology that increases future yields is impossible without access to long-term credit.\nSmallholders, particularly women, often face difficulties in obtaining credit. This is a direct consequence of their lacking access to land, participation in development projects and extension programmes and membership in rural organizations, all of which are important channels for obtaining loans and credit information. In several countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where women and men farmers are roughly equal in number, it is estimated that women farmers receive only 10 percent of the loans granted to smallholders and less than 1 percent of the total credit advanced to the agriculture sector.\nCredit delivery can be improved by setting up microfinance institutions in rural areas and reorienting the banking system to cater to the needs of small farmers, especially women. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which first pioneered the microcredit approach in 1976, currently reaches more than 2 million people. Since it was founded, the bank has lent more than US$2.1 billion, most of it in the form of loans of a few hundred dollars for small agriculture, distribution, crafts and trading enterprises. Numerous studies have shown that women are generally more reliable and punctual in repaying their loans than men are.\nA programme providing credit and nutrition for women significantly improved both the participating women's incomes and their children's nutritional status. This is the conclusion of a study that examined the impact of a credit and education programme run by the NGO Freedom from Hunger.\nMen and women smallholders also suffer financially from limited access to the marketing services that would allow them to turn surplus produce into cash income. Women face particular difficulties because marketing infrastructure and organizations are rarely geared towards either small-scale producers or the crops that women grow. Although women all over the world are active as traders, hawkers and street and market vendors, little has been done to improve transport and market facilities to support this vital economic sector. Even where rural women play an important role in wholesale trade, their full membership in marketing service institutions is still difficult because they may be illiterate or lack independent legal status.\nPlanning for action\nThe FAO Gender and Development Plan of Action includes commitments by different Divisions of FAO to increasing the equality of access to a wide range of agricultural support systems, including markets, credit, technology, extension and training.\nRural finance and marketing services\nRural groups and organizations\nAgricultural research and technology\nAgricultural education and extension\nMicrocredit and education boost incomes and nutrition\nAstudy examined the impact of a microcredit and educational programme implemented by the NGO Freedom from Hunger. In Ghanaian villages, women who participated in the programme used microcredit loans to launch income-generating activities such as preparing and selling palm oil, fish and cooked foods. They increased their non-farm income by $36 per month, twice as much as the women who had not taken part in the programme. Through the programme's educational component, participating women also gained valuable knowledge about their children's nutrition and heath needs.\nMembership of cooperatives, farmers' organizations, trade unions and other organizations represents one of the best ways for rural men and women to gain access to resources, opportunities and decision-making. Cooperatives and farmers' associations generally make it possible for farmers to share the costs and rewards of services that they could not afford on their own. They can be an invaluable channel for obtaining technology, information, training and credit. They can also give smallholders a much louder voice in local and national decision-making. By instituting common food processing, storage and marketing activities, organizations can increase the exchange of goods and services and the access to national and regional markets.\nParticipation in such organizations can be especially important to smallholders and poor farmers, both men and women. But women are frequently deterred from joining because membership is often restricted to recognized landowners or heads of household. Even when women are responsible for the day-to-day management of both households and holdings, their husbands or other male relatives are often considered the official heads.\nIn many regions, women farmers' membership of these organizations is restricted by custom. Where they are able to belong to rural organizations, women often do not share equally in either the decision-making or the benefits, and are excluded from leadership positions. Furthermore, their many household chores may make it impossible for them to attend meetings and devote the time that is necessary for full participation. Investment in labour-saving technologies to relieve the burden of women's unpaid productive and reproductive tasks is needed in order to given them more free time.\nIn recent years there has been some success in reducing the obstacles to women's participation in rural organizations. At the same time, the use and establishment of traditional and new women's groups to promote women's participation in rural development has grown rapidly. However, experience has shown that women's empowerment often requires a step-by-step process to remove the barriers to their membership in organizations that are traditionally dominated by men. Furthermore, it is necessary to give them support, individually or collectively, to enable them to gain the knowledge and self-confidence needed to make choices and take greater control of their lives.\nIn all regions of the developing world, women typically work far longer hours than men do. Studies in Asia and Africa show that women work as much as 13 extra hours a week. As a result, they may have little available time to seek out support services, and very different priorities for the kind of support required.\nOverall, the agricultural research agenda has neglected the needs of smallholders, especially women farmers, and failed to take advantage of their invaluable knowledge about traditional farming methods, indigenous plant and animal varieties and coping techniques for local conditions. Such knowledge could hold the key to developing sustainable approaches that combine modern science with the fruits of centuries of experimentation and adaptation by men and women farmers.\nMost research has focused on increasing the yields of commercial crops and staple grains on high-input farms, where high-yielding varieties can be cultivated under optimal conditions. Smallholders can rarely afford these technology \u00abpackages\u00bb, which are also generally ill suited to the climatic and soil conditions in areas where most of the rural poor live. The crops that farmers in such areas rely on and the conditions that they face have not featured prominently in agricultural research. Sorghum and millet, for example, have received very little research attention and funding, despite their high nutritional value and ability to tolerate difficult conditions. Similarly, relatively little research has been devoted to the secondary crops grown by women, which often provide most of their family's nutritional needs.\nIn addition, agricultural tools and implements are also rarely designed to fit women's physical capabilities or work, so they do not meet women's needs. The impact of new technologies is seldom evaluated from a gender perspective. The introduction of harvesting, threshing and milling machinery, for example, has very little direct effect on yields but eliminates thousands of hours of paid labour. According to one study, if all the farmers in Punjab, India, who cultivate more than 4 ha were to use combine harvesters, they would lose more than 40 million paid working days, without any increase in farm production or cropping intensity. Most of the lost labour and income would be women's.\n\u00abSchools where men and women farmers learn how to increase yields and reduce their reliance on pesticides by relying on natural predators.\u00bb\nDeveloping technology to meet women's specific needs can yield major gains in food production and food security. In Ghana, for example, technology was introduced to improve the irrigation of women's off-season crops. Larger and more reliable harvests increased both food and economic security during the periods between major crops. In El Salvador, where women play an extremely important role in agriculture, it is estimated that as many as 60 percent of households are headed by women. One of the major goals of this country's agriculture sector reform was to improve research and extension activities by focusing on the role of women smallholders. To address women farmers' needs, the project promoted women's participation to help guide the research programme at National Agricultural Technology Centre farms.\nFarmer field schools in Cambodia\nIn fields across Cambodia, men and women farmers gather every week to go to school. They are among the 30 000 Cambodian farmers - more than one-third of them women - who have taken part in FAO-supported farmer field schools (FFS). In the schools, farmers observe how crops develop and monitor pests throughout the growing season. They also learn how natural predators, such as wasps and spiders, can help control pests and how the heavy use of pesticides often kills them off, leaving crops even more vulnerable. These schools emphasize the active participation and empowerment of both men and women farmers. In at least six provinces in Cambodia, farmers have formed integrated pest management (IPM) groups after completing their training, and are carrying out further field studies and experiments. More than 300 farmers have completed additional training and are now organizing farmer field schools in their own areas. \u00ab;I always knew pesticides were bad for my health,\u00bb one participant said, \u00abbut now I know for sure.\u00bb After completing the school, farmers rely more on cultural practices and natural enemies to control pests, and experience fewer cases of poisoning.\nAgricultural extension programmes provide farmers with a lifeline of information about new technologies, plant varieties and market opportunities. In almost all countries, however, the agricultural extension system fails to reach women farmers effectively. Among other reasons, this is because they are excluded from rural organizations. An FAO survey showed that, worldwide, female farmers receive only 5 percent of all agricultural extension services and only 15 percent of agricultural extension agents are women. In Egypt, where women make up more than half of the agricultural labour force, only 1 percent of extension officers are female.\n\u00abAn FAO extension project in Honduras that focused on woman-to-woman training boosted both subsistence production and household food security.\u00bb\nThis reflects the lack of information and understanding about the important role played by women. Extension services usually focus on commercial rather than subsistence crops, which are grown mainly by women and which are often the key to household food security. Available data rarely reflect women's responsibility for much of the day-to-day work and decision-making on the family farm. Nor do they recognize the many other important food production and food processing activities that women commonly perform, such as home gardening, tending livestock, gathering fuel or carrying water.\nExtension programmes can be tailored to address women's priority needs only when men and women farmers are listened to at the village level and when such methods as participatory rural appraisal are employed. In recent years, a number of countries have launched determined efforts to make their extension services more responsive to women's needs. In the Gambia, for example, the proportion of female agricultural extension workers has increased from 5 percent in 1989 to more than 60 percent today. Growth in the number of female extension workers has been matched by increased attention to women's involvement and priorities. A special effort has been made to encourage women's participation in small ruminant and poultry extension services.\nIn Nicaragua, efforts to ensure that extension services match client needs - including giving more attention to the diverse needs of men and women farmers - led to increased use of those services, by 600 percent for women and 400 percent for men.\nExtension programmes that fail to take women into account also fail to address the improved technology and methods that might yield major gains in productivity and food security. Furthermore, they often schedule training times and locations that make it impossible for women to participate, in addition to existing socio-cultural reasons.\nRecommended new approaches include the Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC), which was developed by FAO and introduced in Africa, the Near East, Asia and Latin America. This methodology emphasizes how important it is for field extension workers and small farmers to participate in the strategic planning, systematic management and field implementation of agricultural extension and training programmes. Its extension strategies and messages are specifically developed and tailored to the results of a participatory problem identification and needs assessment.\nTraining Programme for Women's Incorporation in Rural Development\nSeveral hundred peasant women in Honduras were trained to serve as \u00abfood production liaisons\u00bb. After receiving their training, the liaisons worked with grassroots women's groups. They focused on impoverished rural areas where chronic malnutrition is widespread and 70 percent of all breastfeeding mothers suffer from vitamin A deficiency. Women involved with the project increased the subsistence production of nutritious foods. Credits to develop poultry production proved an effective way of increasing motivation, nutritional levels and incomes. Some of the grassroots women's groups involved with the project sought credit through extension agencies or from the Rotating Fund for Peasant Women. The credit was used to initiate other social and productive projects, including purchasing a motorized maize mill and planting soybeans for milk.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6d3aa950-7ad5-4c80-bb68-e826841338b7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/Y3969E/y3969e05.htm", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9660889506340027, "token_count": 2945, "score": 3.21875, "int_score": 3}

However, studies of root growth and N uptake are often restricted to a depth of 1 m or less, as root biomass is assumed to be negligible below this depth. We have studied the importance of root growth and N uptake to a depth of 2.5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15N. Deep rooted crucifereous crops were found to have high root densities to a depth of 1.5-2 m and high 15N uptake to this depth. The work shows that knowledge of the interactions between root growth and soil N below a depth of 1 m are important to understand crop N uptake and nitrate leaching from agro-ecosystems.\n|EPrint Type:||Conference paper, poster, etc.|\n|Type of presentation:||Paper|\n|Subjects:|| Soil > Nutrient turnover|\nCrop husbandry > Crop combinations and interactions\nCrop husbandry > Production systems > Vegetables\n|Research affiliation:|| Denmark > DARCOF III (2005-2010) > VEGQURE - Organic cropping Systems for Vegetable production|\nDenmark > AU - Aarhus University > AU, DJF - Faculty of Agricultural Sciences\n|Deposited By:||Kristensen, Ph.D. Hanne L.|\n|Deposited On:||28 Nov 2007|\n|Last Modified:||12 Apr 2010 07:35|\n|Refereed:||Peer-reviewed and accepted|\nRepository Staff Only: item control page", "id": "<urn:uuid:d2b3502d-1c86-4ed7-9c72-a55bc162b976>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://orgprints.org/11461/", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.7870572805404663, "token_count": 527, "score": 2.90625, "int_score": 3}

Organic alfalfa hay is too new to have a track record, so researchers recorded it as selling for the same price as conventionally grown hay.\nOver four years the study analyzed both economic risks and transition effects of switching to organic farming of the Agricultural Research Service's Swan Lake Research Farm near Morris, Minn.
